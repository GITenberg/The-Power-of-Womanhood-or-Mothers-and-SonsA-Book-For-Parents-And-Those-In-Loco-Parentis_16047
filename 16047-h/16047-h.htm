    <h2><a name="Page_3"
       id="Page_3"></a>PREFACE</h2>

    <p>This little book has been written under great physical
    disabilities, chiefly while wandering about in search of
    health, and consequently far from the libraries which would
    have enabled me to give proper references to all my quotations.
    Often for a whole year I have been unable to touch it; but
    again and again I have returned to my task, feeling it worth
    any risk to mind or body if only in the end its words might
    prove of some service to the educated mothers of England and
    America.</p>

    <p>Under these circumstances, I know I may plead for indulgence
    as to any defects its pages may present.</p>

    <p>But now that, after six years, I have realized the pretty
    Eastern proverb, "By patience and perseverance, and a bottle of
    sweet-oil, the snail at length reaches Jerusalem,"&mdash;now
    that by God's unfailing help I have finished my difficult task,
    I can but commit the book into the hands of the women who have
    implanted in me, next to my faith in God, faith in the "Power
    of Womanhood," and whose faithful adherence and co-operation
    remain the deepest and most grateful memory of my life. Most of
    the ordinary means of circulation are closed to a book of this
    nature. The <a name="Page_4"
       id="Page_4"></a>doors of circulating libraries are for the
       most part shut; notices in papers for the general public are
       necessarily few; nor can I any longer hope, as I once did,
       to visit America, and give it a wide circulation by my own
       efforts. I can but stretch out my hands to my many dear
       unknown friends in America,&mdash;hands which have grown too
       weak to hold the sword or lift the banner in a cause for
       which I have laid down my all,&mdash;and ask any mother who
       may find help or strength in this book to help me in return
       by placing it in the hands of other mothers of boys she may
       know, especially,&mdash;I would plead,&mdash;young mothers.
       Do not say they are too young to know. If they are not too
       young to be the mothers of boys, they are not too young to
       know how to fulfil the responsibility inherent in such
       motherhood. They at least can begin at the beginning, and
       not have occasion to say, as so many mothers have said to
       me, with tears in their eyes, "Oh, if I could only have
       heard you years ago, what a difference it would have made to
       me! But now it is too late."</p>

    <p>Enable me thus, by your aid, to do some helpful work for
    that great country which I have ever loved as my own; and which
    with England is appointed in the Providence of God to lead in
    the great moral causes of the world.</p>

    <p>If, indeed, each mother whom, either by word or deed, I may
    have helped would do me this service of love now that I am laid
    aside, not yielding to the first <a name="Page_5"
       id="Page_5"></a>adverse criticism, which is so often only a
       cry of pain or prejudice, but patiently working on at
       enlightening and strengthening the hands of other mothers in
       her own rank of life, what vital work would be
       done:&mdash;work so precious in its very nature, so
       far-reaching in its consequences, that all the travail and
       anguish I have endured, all the brokenness of body and soul
       I have incurred, would not so much as come into mind for joy
       that a truer manhood is being born into the world, even the
       manhood of Him who&mdash;</p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_I"
       id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

    <h2>INTRODUCTORY</h2>

    <p>In a banquet given in honor of Heinrik Ibsen by a Norwegian
    society known as the Woman's League, in response to a speech
    thanking him in the name of the society for all he had done for
    the cause of women, the poet, while disclaiming the honor of
    having consciously worked for the woman's cause&mdash;indeed,
    not even being quite clear as to what the woman's cause really
    was, since in his eyes it was indistinguishable from the cause
    of humanity&mdash;concluded his speech with the words:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"It has always seemed to me that the great problem is to
        elevate the nation and place it on a higher level. Two
        factors, the man and the woman, must co-operate for this
        end, and it lies especially with the mothers of the people,
        by slow and strenuous work, to arouse in it a conscious
        sense of culture and discipline. To the woman, then, we
        must look for the solution of the problem of humanity. It
        must come from them as mothers: that is the mission that
        lies before them."</p>
    </div>

    <p><a name="Page_10"
       id="Page_10"></a>Whether we are admirers of the great
       Norwegian poet or not, whether we are afflicted with
       Ibsenism, or regard his peculiar genius in a more critical
       and dispassionate light, no one would deny to him that deep
       intuitive insight which belongs to a poet, and which borders
       so closely on the prophet's gift.</p>

    <p>It is now some years since I have been laid aside, owing to
    the terrible strain and burthen of my ten years' conflict with
    the evils that are threatening the sanctity of the family, the
    purity of the home, and all that constitutes the higher life of
    the nation. But in those ten years the one truth that was burnt
    into my very soul was the truth enunciated by Ibsen, that it is
    to the woman that we must look for the solution of the deepest
    moral problems of humanity, and that the key of those problems
    lies in the hands of the mothers of our race. They, and they
    alone, can unlock the door to a purer and a stronger life.
    This, in Ibsen's words, "is the mission that lies before them."
    And it is this strong conviction which makes me feel that, even
    with broken powers and shattered health, I cannot rest from my
    labors without, at any cost to myself, placing the knowledge
    and experience gained in those years of toil and sorrow at the
    disposal of the educated women of the English-speaking world
    who, either as mothers or in other capacities, have the care
    and training of the young.</p>

    <p>No one recognizes more thankfully than I do the
    <a name="Page_11"
       id="Page_11"></a>progress that the woman's movement has made
       during what have been to me years of inaction and suffering.
       The ever-increasing activity in all agencies for the
       elevation of women; the multiplication of preventive
       institutions and rescue societies; above all, that new sense
       of a common womanhood, that <i>esprit de corps</i> in which
       hitherto we have been so grievously lacking, and which is
       now beginning to bind all our efforts together into one
       great whole&mdash;these I thankfully recognize. We no longer
       each of us set up in separate and somewhat antagonistic
       individuality our own little private burrow of good works,
       with one way in and one way out, and nothing else needed for
       the wants of the universe. We realize now that no one agency
       can even partially cover the ground, and conferences are now
       held of all who are working for the good of women and
       children, to enable the separate agencies to work more
       effectually into one another's hands and unite more
       fervently in heart and soul in a common cause. Beneath all
       this, apart from any external organization whatever, there
       is a silent work going on in the hearts of thoughtful and
       educated mothers, which never comes before the public at
       all, but is silently spreading and deepening under the
       surface of our life.</p>

    <p>But when all this is thankfully recognized and acknowledged,
    I still cannot help questioning whether the mass of educated
    women have at all grasped the depth and complexity of the
    problem with which we <a name="Page_12"
       id="Page_12"></a>have to grapple if we are to fufil our
       trust as the guardians of the home and family, and those
       hidden wells of the national life from which spring up all
       that is best and highest in the national character. Nay, I
       sometimes fear lest even our increased activity in practical
       work may not have the effect of calling off our attention
       from those deep underlying causes which must be dealt with
       if we are not to engage in the hopeless task of trying to
       fill a cistern the tap of which has been left running. This
       absorption in the effect and inattention to the cause is to
       a certain degree bred in us by the very nature of the duties
       that devolve upon us as women. John Stuart Mill has compared
       the life of a woman to an "interrupted sentence." The mere
       fact that our lives are so interrupted by incessant home
       calls, and that we are necessarily so concerned in the
       details of life, is apt to make us wanting in grasp of
       underlying principles. Perhaps it is the fact of my having
       been associated all the early years of my life with eminent
       scientific men that has formed in me a habit of mind always
       to regard effects in relation to causes, so that merely to
       cure evil results without striking at the evil cause seems
       to me, to use a Johnsonian simile, "like stopping up a hole
       or two of a sieve with the hope of making it hold
       water."</p>

    <p>It is, therefore, on these deeper aspects that more
    especially bear upon the lives and training of our own sons
    that I want to write, placing before you some facts
    <a name="Page_13"
       id="Page_13"></a>which you must know if you are to be their
       guardians, and venturing to make some suggestions which, as
       the result of much collective wisdom and prayer, I think may
       prove helpful to you in that which lies nearest your heart.
       Only, if some of the facts are such as may prove both
       painful and disagreeable to you, do not therefore reject
       them in your ignorance as false. Do not follow the advice of
       a politician to a friend whom he was urging to speak on some
       public question. "But how can I?" his friend replied; "I
       know nothing of the subject, and should therefore have
       nothing to say." "Oh, you can always get up and deny the
       facts," was the sardonic reply.</p>

    <p>Let me first of all give you my credentials, all the more
    necessary as my long illness has doubtless made me unknown by
    name to many of the younger generation, who may therefore
    question my right to impart facts or make any suggestions at
    all. Suffer me, therefore, to recount to you how I have gained
    my knowledge and what are the sources of my information.</p>

    <p>In the first place, I was trained for the work by a medical
    man&mdash;my friend Mr. James Hinton&mdash;first in his own
    branch of the London profession, and a most original thinker.
    To him the degradation of women, which most men accept with
    such blank indifference, was a source of unspeakable distress.
    He used to wander about the Haymarket and Piccadilly in London
    at night, and break his heart over the sights he saw
    <a name="Page_14"
       id="Page_14"></a>and the tales he heard. The words of the
       Prophet ground themselves into his very soul, with regard to
       the miserable wanderers of our streets: "This is a people
       robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes and
       hid in prison-houses; they are for a prey, and none
       delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore."</p>

    <p>The very first time he came down to me at Brighton, to see
    if I could give him any help, speaking of all he had seen and
    heard, his voice suddenly broke, and he bowed his face upon my
    hands and wept like a child. That one man could suffer as he
    did over the degradation of this womanhood of ours has always
    been to me the most hopeful thing I know&mdash;a divine earnest
    of ultimate overcoming. The only thing that seemed in a measure
    to assuage his anguish was my promise to devote myself to the
    one work of fighting it and endeavoring to awake the conscience
    of the nation to some sense of guilt with regard to it. In
    order to fit me for this work he considered that I ought to
    know all that he as a medical man knew. He emphatically did not
    spare me, and often the knowledge that he imparted to me was
    drowned in a storm of tears. We were to have worked together,
    but his mind, already unhinged by suffering, ultimately gave
    way, and, with all that this world could give him&mdash;health,
    fame, wealth, family affection, devoted friends&mdash;he died
    prematurely of a broken heart.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_15"
       id="Page_15"></a>For ten years, therefore, after my friend's
       death I gave up everything for the purpose of carrying on
       the work he left me, and beat wearily up and down the three
       kingdoms, holding meetings, organizing practical work,
       agitating for the greater legal protection of the young,
       afterwards embodied in two Acts&mdash;one for removing
       children from dens of infamy and one known as the Criminal
       Law Amendment Act, which have done much to educate the
       public sentiment of the country; but always making it my
       chief object to rouse educated women to face the facts about
       their own womanhood, and, above all, to rouse mothers to
       realize the perils of their own boys and to be determined to
       know enough to enable them to act as their guardians.</p>

    <p>During those ten years of warfare, passing as I did from
    family to family, and always concerned with questions that
    touch upon the innermost shrine of our life, I necessarily
    became the recipient of many hidden sorrows. In fact, my
    fellow-creatures used me as a bottomless well into which they
    could empty their household skeletons; and I used often to
    reflect with sardonic satisfaction that I should never run dry
    like other old wells, but that death would come and fill me up
    with a good wholesome shovelful of earth, and I and my
    skeletons would lie quiet together. But in this way I gained a
    knowledge of what is going on under the surface of our life,
    whether we choose to ignore it or not, which possibly can only
    come to those who are set <a name="Page_16"
       id="Page_16"></a>apart to be confessors of their kind; and
       the conclusion was forced upon me that this evil, in one
       form or another, is more or less everywhere&mdash;in our
       nurseries, in our public, and still more our private,
       schools, decorously seated on magisterial benches, fouling
       our places of business, and even sanctimoniously seated in
       our places of worship.</p>

    <p>After the first two years of work among women I found that
    it was absolutely hopeless attacking the evil from one side
    only, and I had to nerve myself as best I could to address
    large mass meetings of men, always taking care clearly to
    define my position&mdash;that I had not come upon that platform
    to help them, but to ask them to help me in a battle that I had
    found too hard for me, and that I stood before them as a woman
    pleading for women. The first of these meetings I addressed at
    the instance of the late revered Bishop of Durham, Dr.
    Lightfoot, who took the chair, and inaugurated the White Cross
    Movement, which has since spread over the civilized world. And
    throughout this most difficult side of my work I had his
    priceless co-operation and approval; besides the wise counsel,
    guidance, and unfailing sympathy of one whom but to name is to
    awake the deepest springs of reverence, Dr. Wilkinson, then the
    incumbent of St. Peter's, Eaton Square, afterwards Bishop of
    Truro, and now Bishop of St. Andrews. But so great was the
    effort that it cost me, that I do not think I could have done
    this <a name="Page_17"
       id="Page_17"></a>part of my work but for my two favorite
       mottoes&mdash;the one, that "I can't" is a lie in the lips
       that repeat, "I believe in the Holy Ghost"; the other,
       received from the lips of Bishop Selwyn, that "If as
       soldiers of the Cross we stick at anything, we are disgraced
       forever."</p>

    <p>But lastly, and perhaps best of all, as giving weight to any
    suggestions that I may make, across the dismal mud swamp that I
    often trod with such an aching heart and faltering steps came
    to meet me God's best and highest, with outstretched hands of
    help and encouragement. It was the highly-cultivated and
    thoughtful women who, amidst the storm of obloquy that beat
    upon me from every quarter, first ranged themselves by my side,
    perceiving that the best way to avoid a danger is not to refuse
    to see it. Some were women already in the field in connection
    with Mrs. Butler's movement, to which our nation owes so much,
    some were roused by my words.</p>

    <p>In all our large towns where I formed Associations for the
    Care of Friendless Girls I was in the habit of reporting my
    work to the clergy of my own church, whose sympathy and
    cooperation I shall ever gratefully acknowledge. Ultimately,
    the leading laity, as well as some Nonconformist ministers,
    joined with us; often these conferences were diocesan
    meetings&mdash;to which, however, Nonconformists were
    invited&mdash;with the Bishop of the diocese in the chair; and
    after <a name="Page_18"
       id="Page_18"></a>my address free discussion took place, so
       that I had the advantage of hearing the opinions and
       judgments of many of our leading men in regard to this
       difficult problem, and getting at men's views of the
       question.</p>

    <p>The matter that I lay before you, therefore, has been
    thoroughly and repeatedly threshed out at such conferences, as
    well as in long, earnest, private talks with the wisest and
    most experienced mothers and teachers of our day; and it is in
    their name, far more than in my own, that I ask you to ponder
    what I say.</p>

    <p>Do not, however, be under any fear that I intend in these
    pages to make myself the medium of all sorts of horrors. I
    intend to do no such thing. It is but very little evil that you
    will need to know, and that not in detail, in order to guard
    your own boys. We women, thank God, have to do with the
    fountain of sweet waters, clear as crystal, that flow from the
    throne of God; not with the sewer that flows from the foul
    imaginations and actions of men. Our part is the inculcation of
    positive purity, not the part of negative warning against vice.
    Nor need you fear that the evil you must know, in order to
    fulfil your most sacred trust, will sully you. This I say
    emphatically, that the evil which we have grappled with to save
    one of our own dear ones does not sully. It is the evil that we
    read about in novels and newspapers, for our own amusement; it
    is the evil that we weakly give way to in our lives; above all,
    it <a name="Page_19"
       id="Page_19"></a>is the destroying evil that we have refused
       so much as to know of in our absorbing care for our own
       alabaster skin&mdash;it is <i>that</i> evil which defiles
       the woman. But the evil that we have grappled with in a life
       and death struggle to save a soul for whom Christ died does
       not sully: it clothes from head to foot with the white robe,
       it crowns with the golden crown. Though I have had to know
       what, thank God! no other woman may ever again be called
       upon to know, I can yet speak of the great conflict that
       involved this knowledge as being the one great purifying,
       sanctifying influence of my life. But even if, as men would
       often persuade us, the knowledge of the world's evil would
       sully us, I know I utter the heart of every woman when I say
       that we choose the hand that is sullied in saving our own
       dear ones from the deep mire that might otherwise have
       swallowed them up, rather than the hand that has kept itself
       white and pure because it has never been stretched out to
       save. That hand may be white, but in God's sight it is white
       with the whiteness of leprosy. Believe, rather, the words of
       James Hinton, written to a woman friend: "You women have
       been living in a dreamland of your own; but dare to live in
       this poor disordered world of God's, and it will work out in
       you a better goodness than your own,"&mdash;even that
       purified womanhood, strong to know, and strong to save,
       before whose gracious loveliness the strongest man grows
       weak as a child, and, as a little child, grows pure.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_20"
       id="Page_20"></a>God grant that, in view of the tremendous
       responsibilities that devolve upon us women in these latter
       days, we may cry from our hearts:</p>

       id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

    <h3>"WHY SHOULD I INTERFERE?"</h3>

    <p>I am, of course, aware that at the very outset I shall be
    met by the question&mdash;far less frequently urged, however,
    by thoughtful mothers than it used to be&mdash;"Why need I
    interfere at all in a subject like this? Why may I not leave it
    all to the boy's father? Why should it be my duty to face a
    question which is very distasteful to me, and which I feel I
    had much better let alone?"</p>

    <p>I would answer at once, Because the evil is so rife, the
    dangers so great and manifold, the temptations so strong and
    subtle, that your influence must be united to that of the boy's
    father if you want to safeguard him. Every influence you can
    lay hold of is needed here, and will not prove more than
    enough. The influence of one parent alone is not sufficient,
    more especially as there are potent lines of influence open to
    you as a woman from which a man, from the very fact that he is
    a man, is necessarily debarred.</p>

    <p>You must bring the whole of that influence to bear for the
    following considerations.</p>

    <p>Let me take the lowest and simplest first. Even if
    <a name="Page_22"
       id="Page_22"></a>you be indifferent to your boy's moral
       welfare, you cannot be indifferent to his physical
       well-being, nay, to his very existence. Here I necessarily
       cannot tell you all I know; but I would ask you thoughtfully
       to study for yourself a striking diagram which Dr.
       Carpenter, in one of our recognized medical text-books, has
       reproduced from the well-known French statistician,
       Quetelet, showing the comparative viability, or life value,
       of men and women respectively at different ages.</p>
    <div class="figcenter"><img width="520" src="images/diagram.png"
    alt="Comparative viability of male and female at different ages." />
    <span class="smcap">diagram representing the comparative viability of the male and female
    at different ages.</span></div>

    <p>The female line, where it differs from the male, is the
    dotted line, the greater or less probability or value of life
    being shown by the greater or less distance of the line of life
    from the level line at the bottom. Infant life being very
    fragile, the line steadily rises till it reaches
    <a name="Page_23"
       id="Page_23"></a>its highest point, between thirteen and
       fourteen. In both cases there is then a rapid fall, the age
       of puberty being a critical age. But from fifteen, when the
       female line begins to right itself, only showing by a gentle
       curve downwards the added risks of the child-bearing period
       in a woman's life, the male line, which ought, without these
       risks, to keep above the female line, makes a sharp dip
       below it, till it reaches its lowest point at twenty-five,
       the age when the excesses of youth have had time to tell
       most on the system.<a name="FNanchor_1_1"
       id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
       class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Here, at least, is evidence that
       none can gainsay. The more you ponder that mysterious sharp
       dip in the man's line of life at the very age which Nature
       intended should be the prime and flower of life, the more
       deeply you will feel that some deep and hidden danger lies
       concealed there, the more earnestly you will come to the
       conclusion that you cannot and will not thrust from you the
       responsibility that rests upon you as the boy's mother of
       helping to guard him from it. Keep him from the knowledge of
       evil, and the temptations that come with that knowledge, you
       cannot. The few first days at school will insure that, to
       say nothing of the miserable streets of our large towns. As
       Thackeray long ago said in a well-known passage, much
       animadverted on at the time:</p>

    <p><a name="Page_24"
       id="Page_24"></a></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"And by the way, ye tender mothers and sober fathers of
        Christian families, a prodigious thing that theory of life
        is, as orally learnt at a great public school. Why! if you
        could hear those boys of fourteen who blush before their
        mothers, and sneak off in silence in the presence of their
        daughters, talking among each other, it would be the
        woman's turn to blush then. Before Pen was twelve years
        old, and while his mother thought him an angel of candour,
        little Pen had heard enough to make him quite awfully wise
        upon certain points; and so, madam, has your pretty
        rosy-cheeked son who is coming home from school for the
        ensuing Christmas holidays. I don't say that the boy is
        lost, or that the innocence has left him which he had 'from
        heaven, which is our home,' but that the shades of the
        prison house are closing very fast round him, and that we
        are helping as much as possible to corrupt
        him."<a name="FNanchor_2_2"
           id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
           class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>But though you cannot keep him from the knowledge of evil,
    you can be a potent factor in teaching him the hidden dangers
    that beset him, in seeing that his young feet rest on the rock
    of true knowledge, and not on the shifting quagmire of the
    devil's lies; but above all, in inspiring him with a high ideal
    of conduct, which will make him shrink from everything low and
    foul as he would from card-sharping or sneaking, proving
    yourself thus to him as far as in you lies&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"A perfect woman, nobly
            planned,<br /></span> <span class="i0">To warn, to
            comfort, and command;<br /></span> <span class="i0">And
            yet a spirit still, and bright<br /></span>
            <span class="i0">With something of an angel
            light."<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The boy thus mothered is saved as a rule from all physical
    risk.</p>

    <p>And this in part anticipates my second point. You
    <a name="Page_25"
       id="Page_25"></a>cannot let this question alone if you are
       to aim at the highest for your boy. High character is more
       to be accounted of than long life. And it is to you, as a
       woman, that the guarding of the higher springs of his nature
       is especially entrusted. My whole experience has gone to
       teach me, with ever-increasing force, that the proposition
       that purity is vitally necessary for the woman, but of
       comparatively small account for the man, is absolutely
       false. Granted that, owing to social ostracism, the outward
       degradation of impurity to the woman is far greater, I
       contend that a deeper inner debasement is its sure fruition
       in the man. Cruelty and lies are its certain accompaniment.
       As Burns, with a poet's insight, has truly said:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"But oh! it hardens a'
            within,<br /></span> <span class="i2">And petrifies the
            feeling."<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Yes, it is exactly that; "it hardens all
    within"&mdash;hardens and darkens. It is as our Lord says: only
    "the pure in heart" are capable of divine vision. Only the man
    who has kept himself pure, who has never sullied his white
    faith in womanhood, never profaned the sacred mysteries of life
    and love, never fouled his manhood in the stye of the
    beast&mdash;it is only that man who can see God, who can see
    duty where another sees useless sacrifice, who can see and
    grasp abiding principles in a world of expediency and
    self-interest, and discern</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"In temporal policy the eternal
            Will,"<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p><a name="Page_26"
       id="Page_26"></a>who can see God in the meanest of His
       redeemed creatures. It is only the virginal heart that has
       kept itself pure, that grows not old, but keeps its
       freshness, its innocent gaiety, its simple pleasures. The
       eminent Swiss Professor, Aimé Humbert, does but echo these
       words from the sadder side, when, speaking of the moral
       malady which is the result of impurity, he says:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"It does not attack any single organ of the human frame,
        but it withers all that is human&mdash;mind, body, and
        soul. It strikes our youth at the unhappy moment when they
        first cross the thresholds of vice. For them the spring has
        no more innocent freshness; their very friendships are
        polluted by foul suggestions and memories; they become
        strangers to all the honorable relations of a pure young
        life; and thus we see stretching wider and wider around us
        the circle of this mocking, faded, worn-out, sceptical
        youth, without poetry and without love, without faith and
        without joy."</p>
    </div>

    <p>Too soon and too earnestly we cannot teach our boys that the
    flaming sword, turning all ways, which guards the tree of life
    for him, is purity.</p>

    <p>But thirdly, there are wider issues than the welfare,
    physical and moral, of our own boys which make it impossible
    for us to take up any neutral attitude on this question. We
    cannot remain indifferent to that which affects so deeply both
    the status and the happiness of women. We cannot accept a
    standard for men which works out with the certainty of a
    mathematical law a pariah class of women. We cannot leave on
    one side the anguish of working-class mothers just because we
    belong to the protected classes, and it is not our girls
    <a name="Page_27"
       id="Page_27"></a>that are sacrificed. At least, we women are
       ceasing to be as base as that, and God forgive us that, from
       want of thought rather than from want of heart, educated
       women could be found even to hold that the degradation of
       their own womanhood is a necessity!</p>

    <p>Take but one instance out of the many that crossed my <i>via
    dolorosa</i> of the anguish inflicted on the mothers of the
    poor. I take it, not because it is uncommon, but because it is
    typical.</p>

    <p>At one of my mass meetings of working women in the North I
    was told at its close that a woman wished to speak with me in
    private. As soon as I could disengage myself from the crowd of
    mothers who were always eager to shake hands with me, and to
    bless me with tears in their eyes for taking up their cause, I
    went down the room, and there, in a dimly-lighted corner of the
    great hall, I found a respectable-looking woman waiting for me.
    I sat down by her side, and she poured out the pent-up sorrow
    of her heart before telling me the one great favor she craved
    at my hands. She had an only daughter, who at the age of
    sixteen she had placed out in service, at a carefully-chosen
    situation. We all know what a difficult age in a girl's life is
    sixteen; but our girls we can keep under our own watchful care,
    and their little wilfulnesses and naughtinesses are got over
    within the four walls of a loving home, and are only the thorns
    that precede the perfect rose of womanhood. But the poor have
    to send their girls <a name="Page_28"
       id="Page_28"></a>out into the great wicked world at this age
       to be bread-winners, often far away from a mother's
       protecting care. The girl, however, in this case was a good,
       steady girl, and for a time did well. Then something
       unsettled her, and she left her first place, and got another
       situation. For a time it seemed all right, when suddenly her
       letters ceased. The mother wrote again and again, but got no
       answer. She wrote to her former place; they knew nothing of
       her. At last she saved up a little money and went to the
       town where she believed her girl to be. She sought out and
       found her last address. The family had gone away, and left
       no address. She made inquiries of the neighbors, of the
       police. Yes, they remembered the girl&mdash;a nice-looking
       girl with a bright color; but no one had seen her lately. It
       was as if a trap-door had opened and let her through. She
       had simply disappeared. In all that crowded city her mother
       could find no trace of her. "It is now thirteen years,
       ma'am, since I lost her."</p>

    <p>But all through those thirteen years that poor mother had
    watched and waited for her. All through those weary years,
    whenever she read in the local paper of some poor girl's body
    being found in the river, some poor suicide, who had leapt,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"Mad from life's history,<br /></span>
            <span class="i0">Swift to death's mystery,<br /></span>
            <span class="i0">Anywhere, anywhere, out of the
            world,"<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>that poor mother would get into her head it might be
    <a name="Page_29"
       id="Page_29"></a>her dear girl that was lying there alone
       and unclaimed; and she would pay her fare&mdash;if she could
       afford it&mdash;or if not, trudge the distance on foot,
       creep, trembling, into the mortuary or the public-house
       where the body lay, blue from drowning, or with the ugly red
       gash across the throat, take one look, and then cry with a
       sigh of relief, "No, it ain't my child," and return again to
       her watching and waiting.</p>

    <p>"Once, ma'am," she said, "I had a dream. I saw a beautiful
    place, all bright and shiny, and there were lots of angels
    singing so sweet, when out of the midst of the glory came my
    poor girl. She came straight to me, and said, 'Oh, mother,
    don't fret; I'm safe and I'm happy!' and with those words in my
    ears I awoke. That dream has been a great comfort to me, ma'am;
    I feel sure God sent it to me. But oh, ma'am," she exclaimed,
    with a new light of hope in her face, and clasping her hands in
    silent entreaty, "the thought came into my head whilst you were
    a-speakin', if you would be so kind as to ask at the end of
    every one of your meetin's, 'Has anyone heard or seen anything
    of a girl of the name of Sarah Smith?' As you go all about the
    country, maybe I might get to hear of her that way."</p>

    <p>Ah me! the pathetic forlornness of the suggestion, the last
    hope of a broken-hearted mother, that I should go all over the
    three kingdoms asking my large <a name="Page_30"
       id="Page_30"></a>audiences, "Have you seen or heard anything
       of Sarah Smith?" And I was dumb. I had not a word of comfort
       to give her. I had heard the words too often from the lips
       of outcast girls in answer to my question, "Does your mother
       know where you are?" "Oh, no; I couldn't bear that mother
       should know about me!"&mdash;not to know what the fate of
       that young girl had been. She had been trapped, or drugged,
       or enticed into that dread under-world into which so many of
       our working-class girls disappear and are lost. Possibly she
       had been sent out of the country, and was in some foreign
       den. One's best hope was that she was dead.</p>

    <p>But picture to yourselves the long-drawn anguish of that
    mother, with nothing but a dream to comfort her amid the dread
    realities of life. Picture her as only one of thousands and
    thousands of our working-class mothers on whose poor dumb
    hearts the same nameless sorrow rests like a gravestone; and I
    think no woman&mdash;no mother, at least&mdash;but will agree
    with me, that this is a matter from which we, as women, cannot
    stand off. Even if we had not the moral and physical welfare of
    our own boys to consider, we are baptized into this cause by
    the tears of women, the dumb tears of the poor. But there is
    one last consideration, exquisitely painful as it is, which I
    cannot, I dare not, pass over, and which more than any other
    has aroused the thoughtful women of England and America to face
    the <a name="Page_31"
       id="Page_31"></a>question and endeavor to grapple, however
       imperfectly as yet, with the problem. For some strange
       reason the whole weight of this evil in its last resort
       comes crushing down on the shoulders of a little
       child&mdash;infant Christs of the cross without the crown,
       "martyrs of the pang, without the palm." The sins of their
       parents are visited on them from their birth, in scrofula,
       blindness, consumption. "Disease and suffering," in
       Dickens's words, "preside over their birth, rock their
       wretched cradles, nail down their little coffins, and fill
       their unknown graves." More than one-half of the inmates of
       our Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children are sent
       there by vice. But would to God it were only innocent
       suffering that is inflicted on the children of our land.
       Alas! alas! when I first began my work, a ward in a large
       London penitentiary, I found, was set apart for degraded
       children! Or take that one brief appalling statement in the
       record of ten years of work&mdash;1884 to 1894&mdash;issued
       by a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. In
       the classification of the various victims it is stated that
       the society had dealt with 4460 pitiable child victims of
       debauchery! Alas for our England, and the debasement which a
       low moral standard for men has made possible in our midst!
       And, judging by the absence of proper legal protection and
       the extraordinarily low age of consent adopted by some of
       the States of the Union, I fear things are not much better
       in America.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_32"
       id="Page_32"></a>One of our sweetest poets, Charles Tennyson
       Turner, in an exquisite sonnet on a three-year-old child
       being presented with a toy globe, has portrayed the
       consecration of a child's innocence, bathing the world
       itself in its baptismal dew:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"She patted all the world; old empires
            peep'd<br /></span> <span class="i0">Between her baby
            fingers; her soft hand<br /></span>
            <span class="i0">Was welcome at all
            frontiers."<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And when at length they turn "her sweet unlearned eye" "on
    our own isle," she utters a little joyous cry:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"Oh yes, I see it! Letty's home is
            there!<br /></span> <span class="i0">And while she hid
            all England with a kiss,<br /></span>
            <span class="i0">Bright over Europe fell her golden
            hair."<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>By the side of that exquisite picture of the beatitude of a
    child's innocence place the picture of that long procession of
    desecrated children, with no "sweet unlearned eye," but eyes
    learned in the worst forms of human wickedness and cruelty; and
    let any woman say, if she can or dare, that this is a subject
    on which she is not called to have any voice and which she
    prefers to let alone. Surely our womanhood has not become in
    these last days such a withered and wilted thing that our ears
    have grown too nice for the cry of these hapless children! As
    women, we are the natural guardians of the innocence of all
    children. The divine motherhood that is at the heart of every
    woman worthy of the name "rises up in wrath" within us and
    cries:<a name="Page_33"
       id="Page_33"></a> "We <i>will</i> fulfil our trust, not only
       to our own children, but to the helpless children of the
       poor." The day is at hand when every mother of boys will
       silently vow before God to send at least one knight of God
       into the world to fight an evil before which even a child's
       innocence is not sacred and which tramples under its swine's
       feet the weak and the helpless.</p>

    <p>Indeed, when one reflects that this great moral problem
    touches all the great trusts of our womanhood, the sanctity of
    the family, the purity of the home, the sacredness of marriage,
    the sweet innocence of children, it seems like some evil dream
    that women can ever have asked, "Why cannot I leave this matter
    to men? Why should I interfere?"</p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_III"
       id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

    <h3>FIRST PRINCIPLES</h3>

    <p>"But what can we do?" will be the next question, uttered
    perhaps in the forlorn accents of a latent despair.</p>

    <p>Before answering this question in detail, I would endeavor
    to impress two cardinal points upon you.</p>

    <p>The first point I want you to recognize, though it may seem
    to minister to the very hopelessness which most lames and
    cripples for effective action, is the depth and magnitude of
    the problem we have to grapple with. All other great social
    evils, with the possible exception of greed or covetousness,
    which in Scripture is often classed with impurity, may be
    looked upon as more or less diseases of the extremities. But
    the evil which we are now considering is no disease of the
    extremities, but a disease at the very heart of our life,
    attacking all the great bases on which it rests. It is not only
    the negation of the sanctity of the family and the destroyer of
    the purity of the home, as I have already pointed out, but it
    is also the derider of the sacredness of the individual, the
    slow but sure disintegrator of the body politic, the dry-rot of
    nations, before which the <a name="Page_35"
       id="Page_35"></a>mightiest empires have crumbled into dust.
       The lagoons of Venice mirror it in the departed grandeur of
       her palaces, overthrown by the licentiousness of her
       merchant princes. The mute sands that silt up the ruins of
       old empires are eloquent of it. The most brilliant
       civilization the world has even seen through it became the
       most transitory. Even the vast and massive structure of the
       Roman Empire, undermined by moral corruption, vanished
       before barbarian hordes like the baseless fabric of a dream.
       To think that we can solve a problem of this depth and
       magnitude by any mere external means&mdash;as so many good
       and earnest women seem to imagine&mdash;by any
       multiplication of Rescue Societies, Preventive Institutions,
       and other benevolent organizations&mdash;is to think that we
       can plug up a volcano with sticks and straws. The remedy,
       like the evil, must be from within, and must to a great
       degree revolutionize our life.</p>

    <p>My second cardinal point is, that the first step we have to
    take, the step which must precede all others, if anything is to
    be of the least avail, must be to restore the moral law and get
    rid of the double standard. I know well how much has been said
    and written on this point; it has been insisted on possibly
    <i>ad nauseam</i>. But even now I do not think we fully realize
    how completely we have been in the grasp of a "tradition of the
    elders," which has emphatically "made the law of God of none
    effect." Side by side with the ethics <a name="Page_36"
       id="Page_36"></a>of Christianity have grown up the bastard
       ethics of society, widely divergent from the true moral
       order. Man has accepted the obligation of purity so far as
       it subserves his own selfish interests and enables him to be
       sure of his own paternity and safeguard the laws of
       inheritance. The precepts which were primarily addressed to
       the man, as the very form of the Greek words demonstrate,
       were tacitly transferred to the woman. When, in a standard
       dictionary of the English language, I look out the word
       "virtue," which etymologically means "manliness"&mdash;the
       manliness which would scorn to gratify its own selfish
       passions at the cost of the young, the poor, and the weak,
       at the cost of a <i>woman</i>&mdash;I find one of its
       meanings defined, not as male but as "female chastity." Long
       ago I suggested that as manliness thus goes by default, the
       word had better be changed from virtue to "muliertue."</p>

    <p>In a passage in one of our standard school-books, Green's
    <i>Short History of the English People</i>, the historian,
    alluding to the coarseness of the early Elizabethan drama,
    remarks that "there were no female actors, and the grossness
    which startles us in words which fall from a woman's lips took
    a different color when every woman's part was acted by a
    boy."<a name="FNanchor_3_3"
       id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"
       class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Why, in the name of all moral
       sense, should it be less dreadful that gross and obscene
       passages should be uttered at a public spectacle by young
       and unformed <a name="Page_37"
       id="Page_37"></a>boys than by adult women, who at least
       would have the safeguard of mature knowledge and instincts
       to teach them their full loathsomeness? Do we really think
       that boys are born less pure than girls? Does the mother,
       when her little son is born, keep the old iron-moulded
       flannels, the faded basinette, the dirty feeding-bottle for
       him with the passing comment, "Oh, it is only a boy!" Is
       anything too white and fine and pure for his infant limbs,
       and yet are we to hold that anything is good enough for his
       childish soul&mdash;even, according to Mr. Green, the
       grossness of the early Elizabethan stage&mdash;because he is
       a boy? But I ask how many readers of that delightful history
       would so much as notice this passage, and not, on the
       contrary, quietly accept it without inward note or comment,
       possessed as we are, often without knowing it, by our
       monstrous double standard?</p>

    <p>If we want to see what is the final outcome of this moral
    code, of this one-sided and distorted ethic, we have only to
    turn our eyes to France. On the one hand we have "la jeune
    fille" in her white Communion robe, kept so pure and ignorant
    of all evil, that "une société ecclésiastique," I am told,
    exists for the emendation of history for her
    benefit&mdash;Divine Providence, as conducting the affairs of
    men, being far too coarse for her pure gaze; and at the other
    end of the stick we find Zola, and a literature intended only
    for the eyes of men, of whose chastity, according
    to<a name="Page_38"
       id="Page_38"></a> Renan, "Nature takes no account
       whatever,"&mdash;a literature which fouls with its vile
       sewage the very wellsprings of our nature, and which,
       whatever its artistic merit, I make bold to say is a curse
       to the civilized world.</p>

    <p>Now, I earnestly protest that while we have this social
    code, which is in direct violation of the moral law, we may set
    on foot any number of Rescue Societies, Preventive Agencies,
    Acts for the Legal Protection of the Young, etc., but all our
    efforts will be in vain. We are like a man who should endeavor
    to construct a perfect system of dynamics on the violation of
    Newton's first law of motion. The tacitly accepted necessity
    for something short of the moral law for men will&mdash;again I
    say it&mdash;work out with the certainty of a mathematical law
    a degraded and outcast class, with its disease, its insanity,
    its foul contamination of the young, its debasement of manhood,
    its disintegration of the State, its curse to the community.
    You cannot dodge the moral law; as Professor Clifford said,
    "There are no back-stairs to the universe" by which we can
    elude the consequences of our wrong, whether of thought or
    action. If you let in one evil premise by the back-door, be
    sure Sin and Death will come out at the front.</p>

    <p>Here, then, you must take a firm and watchful stand. As the
    mothers of the future generation of men, you must look upon it
    as your divinely-appointed task to <a name="Page_39"
       id="Page_39"></a>bring back the moral law in its entirety,
       the one standard equally binding on men and women alike.
       Whatever your creed, you have got to hold fast to this great
       truth, which life itself forces upon you, and which is a
       truth of Christian ethics because first of all it is a truth
       of life. It is simply a moral Q.E.D., that if chastity is a
       law for women&mdash;and no man would deny that&mdash;it is a
       law for every woman without exception; and if it is a law
       for every woman, it follows necessarily that it must be for
       every man, unless we are going to indulge in the moral
       turpitude of accepting a pariah class of women made up of
       other women's daughters and other women's sisters&mdash;not
       our own, God forbid that they should be our own!&mdash;set
       apart for the vices of men.</p>

    <p>But perhaps, looking at our complicated civilization, which,
    at least in the upper classes, involves, as a rule, the
    deferring of marriage&mdash;looking at the strength of the
    passions which generations of indulgence have evolved beyond
    their natural limits, some women will feel constrained to ask,
    "Is this standard a possible one? Can men keep their health and
    strength as celibates? Is not my husband right when he says
    that this is a subject we women can know nothing about, and
    that here we must bow to the judgment of men?"</p>

    <p>I answer that a mother must know by what standard she is to
    educate her boy, and therefore must have the data supplied to
    her on which to form her own judgment, and be fully persuaded
    in her own mind what <a name="Page_40"
       id="Page_40"></a>she is to aim at in the training she is to
       give him; and the mere fact that the current judgment of men
       involves the sacrifice in body and soul of a large class of
       our fellow-women lays a paramount obligation upon all women
       to search for themselves into the truth and scientific
       accuracy of the premises on which that judgment is
       based.</p>

    <p>"Can men keep their health and strength as celibates till
    such time as they have the means to marry?" is the question we
    have, then, to face. Is the standard of the moral law possible
    to men who have to maintain a high level of physical efficiency
    in the sharp competition of modern life?</p>

    <p>Primarily, the answer to this question must come from the
    acknowledged heads of the medical profession. Now, I am
    thankful to say, we have in England a consensus of opinion from
    the representative men of the faculty that no one can gainsay.
    Sir James Paget, Acton in his great text-book, Sir Andrew
    Clark, Sir George Humphrey, of Cambridge, Professor Millar, of
    the Edinburgh University, Sir William Gowers, F.R.S., have all
    answered the above question in the strongest affirmative.
    "Chastity does no harm to body or mind; its discipline is
    excellent; marriage may safely be waited for," are Sir James
    Paget's terse and emphatic words<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
       id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"
       class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. Still more emphatic are the words
       of Sir William Gowers, the great men's specialist, who
       <a name="Page_41"
       id="Page_41"></a>counts as an authority on the Continent as
       well as here:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"The opinions which on grounds falsely called
        'physiological' suggest or permit unchastity are terribly
        prevalent among young men, but they are absolutely false.
        With all the force of any knowledge I possess, and any
        authority I have, I assert that this belief is contrary to
        fact; I assert that no man ever yet was in the slightest
        degree or way the worse for continence or better for
        incontinence. From incontinence during unmarried life all
        are worse morally; a clear majority, are, in the end, worse
        physically; and in no small number the result is, and ever
        will be, utter physical shipwreck on one of the many rocks,
        sharp, jagged-edged, which beset the way, or on one of the
        banks of festering slime which no care can possibly avoid.
        They are rocks which tear and rend the unhappy being who is
        driven against them when he has yielded to the tide of
        passion, they are banks which exhale a poison for which, no
        true antidote exists."</p>
    </div>

    <p>In face of such testimony as this, well might Mr. George
    Russell, in an address to young men, speak of "this exploded
    lie which has hitherto led so many astray."</p>

    <p>Turning now from knowledge to fact, we have only to look at
    the French clergy to see that even in the extreme case of
    life-long celibacy it is not injurious to health. I know, in
    taking this case, I am grating somewhat harshly against
    Protestant prejudice. But the testimony that Renan bears on
    this point is irrefutable. Himself a renegade priest, he
    certainly would not have hesitated to expose the Order to which
    he had once belonged, and vindicate his broken vows by the
    revelation of any moral rottenness known within the
    <a name="Page_42"
       id="Page_42"></a>walls of its seminaries. Far from this, he
       bears the most emphatic testimony in his autobiography that
       there is enough virtue in St. Sulpice alone to convert the
       world; and owns so strong was the impress made on his own
       soul by his training as a priest that personally he had
       lived a pure life, "although," he adds, with an easy shrug
       of his shoulders, "it is very possible that the libertine
       has the best of it!" Another renegade priest, also eminent
       in literature, bears exactly the same testimony. Indeed,
       when we remember the argus-eyed hatred with which the French
       priesthood is watched by the anti-clerical party, and the
       few scandals that appear in the public prints only too
       anxious to give publicity to them, this unimpeachable
       testimony is borne out by fact. I believe this testimony to
       be equally true of the English and Irish Roman Catholic
       clergy. Yet few would dispute the vigor of the physique of
       the Roman Catholic priests, or their capacity for hard and
       often exhausting work.</p>

    <p>Let me, however, guard myself from misapprehension. That a
    celibate life, combined with rich feeding, French novels, and
    low thinking, does produce a great deal of physical harm goes
    almost without saying. Nature, like her Lord, requires truth in
    the inward parts, and takes but small care of outward
    respectabilities that are but the whitewashed graves of inward
    foulness. Surely Lowell is right when he says, "I hold
    unchastity of mind to be worse than that of
    body."<a name="Page_43"
       id="Page_43"></a> To live the unmarried life one must, of
       course, fulfil its conditions of plain living and clean
       thinking.</p>

    <p>It is almost with a feeling of shame that I have dwelt at
    some length on the point we have been considering; but all
    through my ten years of work the sunken rock on which I was
    always making shipwreck was the necessity of the
    evil&mdash;often openly avowed by men, but haunting even the
    minds of women like a shadow&mdash;a shadow which gained
    solidity and substance from a sense of their helpless
    ignorance. I have even met with Christian women who have
    serenely averred to my face that they have been told, on
    authority that they could not question, that, were it not for
    the existence of an outcast class, no respectable woman would
    be safe and we could not insure the purity of the home! So low
    had the moral consciousness fallen, through ignorance and
    thoughtless acceptance of the masculine code, that women
    calling themselves Christians could be found who seemed wholly
    unconscious of the deep inner debasement of accepting the
    degradation of other women as a safeguard to our own virtue and
    of basing the purity of the Christian home on the ruined bodies
    and souls of the children of the poor. Truly the dark places of
    the world within, as well as of the world without, are full of
    cruelty!</p>

    <p>What can I do, in the face of such an experience as this,
    but humbly and earnestly beseech the women of England and
    America not to play fast and loose with <a name="Page_44"
       id="Page_44"></a>the moral sense within them&mdash;- which
       is God's voice within us&mdash;but to hold fast to the moral
       law, one, equal, and indivisible, for men and women alike;
       and to know and feel sure that, whatever else is bound up
       with the nature of man or with an advancing civilization,
       the hopeless degradation of woman is not that something. It
       is God who has made us&mdash;not we ourselves, with our
       false codes, false notions, and false necessities; and God
       has made the man to love the woman and give himself for her,
       not to degrade her and destroy the very function for which
       she was made the blessed "mother of all living."</p>

    <p>Only be sure of this: that men will rise to the level of any
    standard that we set them. For the present standard of what
    Sainte Beuve calls "l'homme sensuel moyen," which we have
    accepted and tacitly endorsed, we women are largely to blame.
    In my conferences with the clergy and earnest laity held in all
    our large towns it was always this that men spoke of as the
    greatest stumbling-block in their way. With the utmost
    bitterness they would urge that men of known fast life were
    admitted into society, that women seemed to prefer them rather
    than not; and it seemed to make no difference to them what kind
    of life a man led&mdash;whether he reverenced their womanhood
    or not. How could I deny this bitter accusation in the face of
    facts? All I could urge in extenuation was that I believed it
    was due rather to the ignorance than to the indifference
    <a name="Page_45"
       id="Page_45"></a>of women, owing to the whole of this dark
       side of life having been carefully veiled from their view;
       but now that this ignorance was passing away, I was only one
       of hundreds of women who ask nothing better than to lay down
       their lives in the cause of their own womanhood. Only when
       women learn to respect themselves; only when no woman worthy
       the name will receive into her own drawing-room in friendly
       intercourse with her own girls the man who has done his best
       to make her womanhood a vile and desecrated thing; only when
       no mother worthy the name will, for the sake of wealth or
       position,&mdash;what is called "a good match,"&mdash;give
       her pure girl to a man on the very common conditions, as
       things have been, that some other ten or twenty young
       girls&mdash;some poor mothers' daughters&mdash;have been
       degraded and cast aside into the gutter, that she, the
       twenty-first in this honorable harem, may be held in
       apparent honor as a wife; only when no woman worthy the name
       will marry under the conditions portrayed by our great
       novelist, George Eliot,&mdash;that of another woman being
       basely forsaken for her sake&mdash;then, and then only, will
       this reproach that men level at us drop off; then, and then
       only, shall we be able to save our own sons and bring in a
       better and purer state of things, enabling them to fight the
       battle of their life at less tremendous odds; then, and then
       only, shall we be able to evolve the true manhood, whose
       attitude is not to defile and destroy, but "to look up and
       to lift up."</p>

    <h3>THE SECRET AND METHOD</h3>

    <p>There is a simile of Herbert Spencer's, in his book on
    Sociology, which has often helped me in dealing with great
    moral problems. He says:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"You see that wrought-iron plate is not quite flat; it
        sticks up a little here towards the left, 'cockles,' as we
        say. How shall we flatten it? Obviously, you reply, by
        hitting down on the part that is prominent. Well, here is a
        hammer, and I give the plate a blow as you advise. Harder,
        you say. Still no effect. Another stroke. Well, there is
        one, and another, and another. The prominence remains, you
        see; the evil is as great as ever, greater, indeed. But
        this is not all. Look at the warp which the plate has got
        near the opposite edge. Where it was flat before it is now
        curved. A pretty bungle we have made of it! Instead of
        curing the original defect, we have produced a second. Had
        we asked an artisan practised in 'planishing,' as it is
        called, he would have told us that no good was to be done,
        but only mischief, by hitting down on the projecting part.
        He would have taught us how to give variously directed and
        specially adjusted blows with a hammer elsewhere, so
        attacking the evil not by direct but by indirect actions.
        The required process is less simple than you thought. Even
        a sheet of metal is not to be successfully dealt with after
        those common-sense methods in which you have so much
        confidence. 'Do you think I am easier to be played on than
        a pipe?' asked Hamlet. Is humanity more readily
        straightened than an iron plate?"<a name="FNanchor_5_5"
           id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"
           class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
    </div>

    <p><a name="Page_47"
       id="Page_47"></a>Now, in our moral "planishing" we need to
       know where and how to direct our blows, lest in endeavoring
       to lessen the evil we not only increase the evil itself, but
       produce other evils almost as great as the one we intended
       to cure. The mistake that we commit&mdash;and this is, I
       think, especially true of us women&mdash;is to rush at our
       moral problems without giving a moment's thought to their
       causes, which often lie deep hidden in human nature. Our
       great naturalist, Darwin, gave eight years' study to our
       lowly brother, the barnacle; he gave an almost equal amount
       of time to the study of the earthworm and its functions,
       revealing to us, in one of his most charming books, how much
       of our golden harvest, of our pastures, and our jewelled
       garden-beds, we owe to this silent and patient laborer. Yet
       we think that we can deal with our higher and more complex
       human nature without giving it any study at all. We hit down
       directly on its moral inequalities, without giving a thought
       to what has caused the imperfection, when constantly, as in
       the sheet of metal which has to be straightened, the moral
       disorder has to be met, not directly, but
       indirectly&mdash;not at the point of the disorder itself,
       but of its often unsuspected cause. Purity, like health,
       like happiness, like so many of the higher aims of our life,
       has to be attained altruistically. Seek them too directly,
       and they elude our grasp. Like the oarsman, we have often to
       turn our back upon our destination in order to arrive at our
       end.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_48"
       id="Page_48"></a>Do not, therefore, think impatiently that I
       am putting you off with vague theories when you want
       practical suggestions, if I ask you first to give some
       patient thought to the causes of the disorder which seems to
       mark the side of our human nature on which the very
       existence of the race depends, and which cannot, therefore,
       be evil in itself. To me the problem presented was almost
       paralyzing. It seemed as if Nature, in her anxiety to secure
       the continuance of the species, had taken no account
       whatever of the moral law, but had so overloaded the
       strength of passion as not only to secure the defeat of the
       moral law, but even of her own ends, by producing the
       sterility which results from vicious indulgence. It was not
       till I met with two wonderful sermons on "The Kingdom of
       God," by that great master of "divine philosophy," Dr. James
       Martineau, that I first got a clue to the moral difficulty
       and to that fuller understanding of our human nature which
       is so essential to all who have the training and moulding of
       the young. And, therefore, I ask you to let me enter at some
       length into this teaching, which will not only give us light
       for our own guidance, but enable us to grasp the right
       principles on which we have to act in the moral training of
       the coming generation.<a name="FNanchor_6_6"
       id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"
       class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

    <p><a name="Page_49"
       id="Page_49"></a>Now, in trying to think out the laws of our
       own being, we are met at the very outset by the great crux
       in the moral world: What is the true relation of the
       material to the spiritual,&mdash;of the body, with its
       instincts and appetites, to the moral personality, with its
       conscience and will? On the one hand, seeing the fatal
       proneness of man to obey his appetites and run into terrible
       excesses, ascetics in all ages and of all creeds have taught
       that the body itself is evil and the seat of sin; that its
       instincts must be crushed and its appetites repressed and
       eradicated; and that it is only so far as you trample your
       animal nature under foot that you can rise to be a saint.
       "Brute," "blind," "dead," have been the epithets bestowed on
       matter, which is a ceaseless play of living forces that rest
       not day nor night. To look down on the material pleasures
       with suspicion, to fly contact with the rude world and lose
       one's self in the unembodied splendors of the spiritual, to
       save souls rather than men and women, to preach abstract
       doctrines rather than grapple with hideous concrete
       problems&mdash;this has been the tendency of the religious
       spirit in all ages, a tendency of which positive asceticism,
       with its mortification of the body, and its ideal of
       virginity, and marriage regarded as more or less a
       concession to the flesh, is only an exaggeration.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_50"
       id="Page_50"></a>On the other hand, in disgust at the
       mutilation of human nature and under pretext of its
       consummation, has arisen the "fleshly school," whose maxim
       is "obedience to Nature,"&mdash;leaving undefined what
       nature, the nature of the swine or the nature of the
       man,&mdash;which holds that every natural instinct ought to
       be obeyed, which takes the agreeable as the test of the
       right, and which goes in for the "healthy animal" with
       enlightened self-interest as the safeguard against
       excesses.</p>

    <p>Alas! the results are no happier. The healthy animal treads
    under his feet the helpless and the weak, who suffer that he
    may grow fat and kick. The attractive warmth and color and
    richness are found to be but rottenness and decay.</p>

    <p>When, dissatisfied with the teaching of men, one turns to
    the great world at large, to see whether some practical
    instinct may not have guided men to a right adjustment, one's
    first feeling is one of dismay at the spectacle presented. The
    bodily instincts and appetites that seem to work aright in the
    animal world, in man seem fatally overloaded, and, instead of
    hitting the mark, explode with disaster and death at the
    outset.</p>

    <p>Let us now turn to the teaching of Christ, and see whether
    it does not explain the deep disorder of the animal instincts
    in the world of man, and while saving us on the one hand from
    the self-mutilation of <a name="Page_51"
       id="Page_51"></a>asceticism, and from the swinishness of the
       fleshly school on the other, whether it does not embrace the
       truth that is in both and teach us how to correlate the
       material and the spiritual.</p>

    <p>Now, Dr. Martineau points out that Christ teaches, in
    contradistinction to asceticism, that the animal body, with its
    instincts and appetites, is as good on its own plane as the
    higher and spiritual attributes of man are on theirs. Our
    Father knoweth that, in common with other creatures, we have
    need of physical good, and He has provided us with a
    self-acting mechanism for its attainment, which will work
    rightly if only it is left alone and not tampered with. There
    is the same provision in us as in them of unconscious instincts
    and appetites for carrying on the lower life which is necessary
    as the platform of the higher spiritual being, to set it free,
    as it were, for the pursuit of its legitimate ends&mdash;all
    those higher and wider interests in life which are comprised
    under the one comprehensive name of "the kingdom of God." And
    the teaching of Christ is: Neither hate nor fear this part of
    your nature with the ascetic, nor pamper and stimulate it with
    the Hedonist, but let it alone to act on its own plane; trust
    it, trust God who made it, while you throw all your conscious
    energies into the higher concerns of life; and you will find,
    when left to its own unconscious activity, it is neither an
    over-nor an under-provision for carrying on your subsistence
    and that of the <a name="Page_52"
       id="Page_52"></a>race. "Take no anxious thought (&mu;&eta;
       &mu;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&mu;&nu;&#942;&sigma;&eta;&tau;&epsilon;)
       for the morrow." "Your Father knoweth that ye have need of
       these things," and has arranged your being accordingly.
       "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all these things
       shall be added to you." "Behold the birds of the air; your
       heavenly Father feedeth them."</p>

    <p>"Oh," says the practical man at once, "that is all very fine
    as sentiment; it is very Eastern and poetical; but I should
    like to know how, in these overcrowded days, I could support
    myself and family if I am to trust God to feed me and them like
    the birds of the air, and only think about religion." But is
    not this wholly to misunderstand our Lord's teaching? How does
    God feed the birds of the air? Is it not by incessant and
    untiring effort on their part? Those who have watched a pair of
    birds flying backwards and forwards to the nest under the eave
    may well question whether industry can go further. But in the
    unconscious being of a bird it is toil without
    &mu;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&mu;&nu;&alpha;, without thought and
    worry, and becomes, therefore, the very picture to us of trust
    in a higher Power, who has thus adjusted an unerring instinct
    to an unfailing end. The insect and the bird provide for the
    morrow, while they take no anxious thought for the morrow. "The
    agility which achieves it is theirs, the skill and foresight
    absent from them remain with God. And thus the simple life of
    lower natures, in its unconscious surrender to
    <a name="Page_53"
       id="Page_53"></a>involuntary though internal guidance,
       becomes the negative type of perfect
       trust."<a name="FNanchor_7_7"
       id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"
       class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

    <p>But to leave his instincts and appetites to work, unimpeded
    and unconscious, on their own plane, while he concerns himself
    with matters of truly human interest, is just what man is not
    content to do. On the contrary, he takes his higher and
    spiritual nature down into them. He enhances their pleasure
    with all the powers of his imagination; he sets his intellect
    to work to plot and plan for their gratification; he loads them
    with the whole force of his spiritual will, and in so doing he
    overloads and maddens them. The instinct for food and drink,
    which in the animal is sufficient for the maintenance of health
    and activity, in the man becomes gluttony and drunkenness; the
    instinct for the preservation of the race becomes the
    licentiousness which produces sterility and defeats its own
    ends; the instinct of self-maintenance becomes the feverish
    greed and money-getting which leave no room for the higher life
    of beauty, and science, and worship, and disinterested service.
    "Seek ye first the material," says the world, "and all these
    things shall be added unto you when you get the time for
    them"&mdash;which will be probably never.</p>

    <p>Now, then, do we not begin to see why the animal instincts
    and appetites, which make for order and happiness, and fufil
    their end in the animal world, lead to <a name="Page_54"
       id="Page_54"></a>such intolerable disorder in the world of
       man? Their laws, like all other laws in the Divine economy,
       are holy and just and good; but man by not observing their
       conditions makes them work evil and death. Do you not see
       that to be a healthy animal is just what man cannot be
       except by being a true and high-minded man, all his
       conscious energies taken up and absorbed on a higher plane,
       with none left over to filter down into and disorder the
       animal instincts, which only work aright when left to their
       own unconscious activity? Fix your consciousness long enough
       on the tip of your little finger, and you will feel a
       pricking sensation in it. The mind directed intently to any
       part of the frame will produce a flow of blood there. Any
       physician will tell you that this is one of the greatest
       difficulties he has to contend with in his patients; the
       mind being steadily directed to some disordered spot
       increases the congestion which is the result of disease.</p>

    <p>Unconsciousness, therefore, is the very channel in which our
    animal nature works healthily and undisturbed according to its
    own laws. But you are a self-conscious being, and not as the
    animals. God keeps the keys of their nature in His own hands.
    They are shut up to certain ends which are in His purpose
    rather than in their minds. They are locked within limits of
    their nature, which are absolute, and cannot, therefore, be
    transgressed. But man, in virtue of his self-consciousness, is
    emphatically "he who hath the keys, <a name="Page_55"
       id="Page_55"></a>who openeth and no man shutteth, and who
       shutteth and no man openeth." All the secret recesses of
       your being lie open to you, and no man can close it to your
       vision. You can voluntarily shut the door of salvation and
       hamper the lock, and no man can open. A limit is no absolute
       limit to you because your very consciousness of the limit
       involves your consciousness of the beyond which makes it a
       limit. And therefore to you as a self-knowing existence,
       with your being necessarily surrendered into your own hands,
       two faculties have been given as a substitute for the
       unconscious necessity of an animal nature: First, a
       self-judging faculty which we call conscience, or a power of
       discerning between a lower and a higher, and a sense of
       obligation to the higher which enables you to correlate your
       faculties and functions in their true order of relative
       excellence; and secondly, a spiritual will, capable of
       carrying the decisions of conscience into practical
       execution and attaining to a necessity of moral law. The
       true function of man's will is not, therefore, to add itself
       on to any one of his instincts and give it a disordered
       strength, but, while throwing its chief conscious energies
       into the higher interests of life, to rule his instincts and
       appetites according to those higher interests. This, when
       the condition of that infinitely complex thing, modern
       civilized life, interferes, as at times it must do, with the
       legitimate exercise of his instincts, and his good has to be
       <a name="Page_56"
       id="Page_56"></a>subordinated to the good of the greater
       number, may occasionally involve a hard struggle, even when
       the instincts have been left to their own healthy natural
       play; but at least it will be all the difference between a
       struggle with a spirited animal and a maddened and
       infuriated brute.</p>

    <p>"But," asks Dr. Martineau, "if the animal instincts and
    appetites are to be directed by conscience and ruled by the
    will in accordance with the dictates of conscience, what
    becomes of the unconsciousness which is necessary for their
    right action? Its place is gradually supplied by habit, which
    is the unconsciousness of a self-conscious being." The habit of
    plain living and spare food, so necessary to high thinking, at
    first acquired possibly by real effort of will, by real fasting
    and prayer, becomes a second nature, that sets the will free
    for higher conquests. The habit of purity, which at first may
    have resulted only from a sleepless watch of the will in
    directing the thoughts and imagination into safe channels,
    becomes an instinctive recoil from the least touch of
    defilement. The habit of unworldly simplicity, which may have
    had to be induced by deliberate self-denial, becomes a natural
    disposition which rejects superfluities from unconscious
    choice.</p>

    <p>This is what takes place where direct conflict is
    necessitated by the constant readjustment of the individual,
    with his instincts and appetites, to his social environment
    which so complex a state of society as that <a name="Page_57"
       id="Page_57"></a>of modern civilization involves. But under
       ordinary circumstances, where the teaching of Christ is
       observed and all the conscious energies of the man are
       absorbed in seeking first the kingdom of God, there the need
       of conflict on the lower plane is at least partially done
       away with. The whole current of thought and will, flowing
       into higher channels, is drained away from the lower
       instincts and appetites, which are thus restored to their
       natural unconsciousness, with only an occasional
       interference on the part of the will to subordinate them to
       human ends and aims, or to those demands of a high and
       complex civilization in the benefits of which we all share,
       but for whose fuller and richer life we have in some
       directions to pay, and perhaps at times to pay heavily. The
       scientific man who in his passionate devotion to the search
       after truth&mdash;the kingdom of God as revealed in the
       order of the universe&mdash;exclaimed testily that he had no
       time to waste in making money, had no conflict with the
       instinct of self-subsistence maddened into greed. It worked
       out a sufficient quotient of bread and cheese to insure the
       healthy exercise of his brain, and that was enough. The
       Alpine climber, intent on mastering a printless snow-peak,
       has not to control an appetite sharpened by mountain air
       from sinking into the gluttony which would be fatal to the
       cool head and steady foot necessary for his enterprise. The
       man who has a noble passion for the weak and defenceless,
       who from the first has cultivated a <a name="Page_58"
       id="Page_58"></a>chivalrous loyalty to women, putting far
       from him the lowering talk, the cynical expression, the
       moral lassitude of society, and guarding his high enthusiasm
       from the blight of worldly commonplace, has no need to fight
       against the lower instinct that would degrade them or wrong
       the weak and defenceless. The conflict is there, but it is
       removed to a nobler and higher battle-field, a battle
       against the sacrifice of the weak by the strong, whilst in
       him the lower life may be left to settle itself, as in the
       unconscious birds of the air. "Love God," as St. Augustine
       said, "and do what you will." "Be a child of the water, and
       you may be a child of the wind, blowing where it listeth."
       "Seek the kingdom of God first, and all these things shall
       be added to you."</p>

    <p>This, then, is the first great practical lesson that we
    learn from the study of the laws of our human nature, taken in
    their widest aspect, under the teaching of the Divine Master,
    the "open secret" of overcoming in man and woman alike, that
    which restores to us our whole nature, and vindicates it, even
    in the depths of disorder into which it has practically fallen,
    as originally bearing the Divine stamp. The more unconscious we
    are in the pursuit of physical good, the better for the ends of
    life; the more conscious we are in the pursuit of moral and
    spiritual good, the nearer we are to that kingdom of
    righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost which we
    seek. Get out of the narrow <a name="Page_59"
       id="Page_59"></a>individualism or atomism&mdash;for let us
       never forget that individual and atom are the same
       word&mdash;which threatens to dwarf and pulverize us, which
       keeps within our view only the narrow range of our own
       interests and defeats their true pursuit by the very
       intensity of attention it concentrates upon them; and live,
       as Goethe says, "in the beautiful, the good, and the whole,"
       the kingdom of the Eternal. Have the higher passion that
       casts out the lower. The physician whose conscious aim is
       the relief of human suffering and the enforcement of the
       laws of health, even though a large professional income may
       be added to him; the lawyer who regards himself as the
       minister of the Just One to uphold the law of right and
       equity, whose reputation does not rest on his skill in
       getting off a fraudulent company without costs, and who
       makes his money not by his "practices," but by his honest
       practice; the man of science who reverently devotes himself,
       as the servant of the truth, to "think God's thoughts after
       Him," in the words of Kepler's prayer, and establish the
       kingdom of law and order, in the humbleness of conscious
       limitation which forbids dogmatizing; the artist who is true
       to his art and does not subordinate the laws of the eternal
       Loveliness to the shifting laws of the temporary market; the
       capitalist who looks upon himself as the steward of the
       public good, and to whom material gain is the means and not
       the end; the workman who does good work for the kingdom of
       God's sake, knowing <a name="Page_60"
       id="Page_60"></a>that every stroke of good work is a brick
       in the palace of the great King, and who scorns to scamp
       because it pays; and, generally speaking, every man who is
       so intent on helping and serving others that his thoughts
       are taken off himself and centred on another&mdash;these are
       the men who are seeking first a kingdom of God, wherein
       dwelleth righteousness; these are the men who, living in the
       higher life can rule the lower&mdash;the men whose feet are
       in the lilies, and to whom the floods of earthly passion,
       even when they beat hardest, end in the flight of a dove and
       in a triumphal arch of light.</p>

    <p>Now, you will see at once the intensely practical bearing of
    this teaching on the training of your boys. You are not called
    to hit down directly on the evil, to give warnings against
    vice, or to speak on things which your womanhood unspeakably
    shrinks from mentioning. What you are called to do is to
    secure, so far as you can, that the mind and soul moves on its
    own proper plane. It is more an attitude you have to form than
    a warning you have to give. And here it is that the imperative
    need of high positive teaching comes in. Till parents, and
    especially mothers, recognize their God-given functions as the
    moral teachers of their own children, till they cease to shunt
    off their responsibilities on the professional shoulders of the
    schoolmaster, we had better frankly give up the whole question
    in despair. Strange and sad it seems to me that at the end of
    the nineteenth century after the coming of our<a name="Page_61"
       id="Page_61"></a> Lord I should have to plead that the moral
       law is possible under every condition to any man, and that
       parents are <i>ipso facto</i> the moral teachers of their
       own children. And yet it is the denial, tacit or explicit,
       of these two primary truths that has been the greatest
       obstacle to the progress of my work.</p>

    <p>But I appeal to you: Who but a mother can bring such a
    constant and potent influence to bear as to secure the mind and
    character moving on its own higher plane in relation to the
    whole of this side of our nature? Who so well as a mother can
    teach the sacredness of the body as the temple of the Eternal?
    Who else can implant in her son that habitual reverence for
    womanhood which to a man is "as fountains of sweet water in the
    bitter sea" of life? Who like a mother, as he grows to years of
    sense and observation, and the curiosity is kindled, which is
    only a cry for light and teaching, can so answer the cry and so
    teach as to make the mysteries of life and truth to be for ever
    associated for him with all the sacred associations of home and
    his own mother, and not with the talk of the groom or the
    dirty-minded schoolboy? Who so well as a mother, as he passes
    into dawning manhood, can plead faithfulness to the future wife
    before marriage as well as after? Nay, as I hold by the old
    Spanish proverb "An ounce of mother is worth a pound of
    clergy," who like a mother, by her prayers and ever-present
    example and influence, can lead him to the Highest, and
    <a name="Page_62"
       id="Page_62"></a>impress upon him that his life is given him
       for no lower end than, in the words of the Westminster
       Confession, "to know God and to glorify Him for ever"; and
       that therefore he is made on a very high plan&mdash;as
       Browning puts it, "Heaven's consummate cup," whose end is to
       slake "the Master's thirst"; and that the cup from which He
       drinks must be clean inside as well as out, and studded
       within and without with the pearl of purity?</p>

    <p>But refuse to give him this higher teaching and training; go
    on, as so many mothers have done, blankly ignoring the whole
    subject, because it is so difficult to speak to one's
    boys,&mdash;as if everything worth having in this life were not
    difficult!&mdash;leave him to the teaching of dirty gossip, of
    unclean classical allusions in his school-books, of scraps of
    newspaper intelligence, possibly of bad companions whom he may
    pick up at school or business, and be sure of it, as this side
    of his nature is awakened&mdash;in his search after gratified
    curiosity or pleasurable sensation, in utter ignorance of what
    he is doing, through your fault, not through his&mdash;he will
    use his imagination and his will to strengthen the animal
    instincts. What ought to have been kept on a higher plane of
    being will be used to stimulate functions just coming into
    existence, and pre-eminently needing to be let alone on their
    own plane to mature quietly and unconsciously. Thus dwelt upon
    and stimulated, these functions become in a measure
    <a name="Page_63"
       id="Page_63"></a>disordered and a source of miserable
       temptation and difficulty, even if no actual wrong-doing
       results. If you only knew what those struggles are, if you
       only knew what miserable chains are forged in utter helpless
       ignorance, you would not let any sense of difficulty or
       shrinking timidity make you refuse to give your boy the
       higher teaching which would have saved him.</p>

    <p>It is told of the beautiful Countess of Dufferin, by her son
    and biographer, Lord Dufferin, that when the surgeons were
    consulting round her bedside which they should save&mdash;the
    mother or the child&mdash;she exclaimed, "Oh, never mind me;
    save my baby!" If you knew the facts as I know them, I am quite
    sure you would exclaim, in the face of any difficulties, any
    natural shrinking on your part, "Oh, never mind me, let me save
    my boys!"</p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_V"

    <h3>EARLY BOYHOOD</h3>

    <p>Having now laid down the general principles which we have to
    recognize in the moral training of the young, let me endeavor
    to make some practical suggestions how these principles may be
    carried out, suggestions which, as a matter of fact, I have
    found to be helpful to educated mothers in the great and
    responsible task of training the men of the future
    generation.</p>

    <p>All I would earnestly ask you to remember is, that in
    offering these suggestions I am in no way venturing to dictate
    to you, only endeavoring to place a wide experience at your
    service. Doubtless you will often modify and, in some cases,
    very possibly reverse my conclusions. All I ask is that you
    should weigh them thoughtfully and prayerfully and with an open
    and unprejudiced mind before you finally reject them.</p>

    <p>Let us, therefore, begin with the nursery. It is in the
    nursery that the roots of the evil we have to contend with are
    often first planted, and this in more senses than one. In the
    more obvious sense all experienced mothers know what I mean.
    But I am quite <a name="Page_65"
       id="Page_65"></a>sure that there are a large number of young
       wives who become mothers without the smallest knowledge of
       the dangers to which even infant boys may be exposed. This
       ignorance is painfully shown by the frequent application for
       nursemaids from our penitentiaries. At one house where I
       held a small meeting my young hostess, an intelligent
       literary woman, came into my room after the household had
       retired to rest to ask me about some curious actions which
       she had noticed in her baby boy at night. There could not be
       a doubt or a question that her nurse was corrupting her
       little child before that hapless young mother's eyes, and
       forming in him habits which could only lead to misery
       hereafter, and only too possibly to idiocy and death; and
       that young mother was too ignorant to save her own baby boy!
       Indeed, I know of no greater instance of the cruelty of "the
       conspiracy of silence" than the fact that in all the
       orthodox medical manuals for young mothers the necessary
       knowledge is withheld.<a name="FNanchor_8_8"
       id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"
       class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But more marvellous still is the
       fact that women should ever have placidly consented to an
       ignorance which makes it impossible for them to save even
       baby boys from a corrupt nursemaid, who by some evil chance
       may have found her way into their service through a false
       character or under some other specious disguise, not seeing
       at once that the so-called delicacy <a name="Page_66"
       id="Page_66"></a>which shrinks from knowing everything that
       is necessary in order to save is not purity but
       prurience.</p>

    <p>I would, therefore, beseech young mothers who are conscious
    of their own ignorance to see a lady doctor, if they do not
    like to consult their own family physician, and ask her to tell
    them plainly what they have to guard against and the best
    methods to pursue. All I can say here is to beseech every
    mother to be absolutely careful about the antecedents of her
    nursemaids, and only to admit those of unblemished character
    into the precincts of the nursery. Never, if possible, let your
    baby boy sleep with any one but yourself, if through illness or
    any other cause he cannot sleep in his own little cot. Pyjamas,
    I think, are generally recognized now to be the best form of
    night gear, as keeping the little limbs warm and covered, when
    in the restlessness of sleep the child throws off the
    bedclothes, as well as for other and more vital reasons. If
    through straitened means you cannot afford an experienced
    nurse&mdash;not that I should altogether allow that even the
    experienced nurse is to be implicitly and blindly trusted until
    she has been well tested&mdash;then I would entreat you not to
    let sleepiness or ill health or any other excuse prevent you
    from being always present at your boy's morning bath. Often and
    often evil habits arise from imperfect washing and consequent
    irritation; and many a wise mother thinks it best on this
    account to revert to the old Jewish rite of initiation by which
    <a name="Page_67"
       id="Page_67"></a>cleanliness was secured. Teach them from
       the first self-reverence in touch, as in word and deed, and
       watch even their attitudes in sleep, that the little arms
       are folded lightly upwards. Even experienced nurses are not
       always nice in their ways. Be vigilantly watchful that the
       utmost niceness is observed between the boys and girls in
       the nursery, and that childish modesty is never broken down,
       but, on the contrary, nurtured and trained. Knowledge and
       watchfulness are the two cherubim with the flaming sword
       turning all ways to guard the young tree of life and bar the
       way of every low and creeping thing. If I may venture in
       some sort to reverse our Lord's words, I should say His word
       to all mothers is, "What I say unto all I say especially
       unto you, <i>Watch</i>."</p>

    <p>But there is another and a deeper sense in which the root of
    the evil is first planted and nourished in the nursery. If we
    are to contend with this deadly peril to soul and body, I
    cannot but feel that we must bring about a radical change in
    the training of our boys. There must be some radical defect in
    that training for men to take the attitude they do. I do not
    mean bad, dissipated men, but men who in all other relations of
    life would be designated fairly good men. Once let such a man
    be persuaded&mdash;however wrongly&mdash;that his health, or
    his prospect of having some day a family of his own, will
    suffer from delayed marriage and he considers the question
    settled. He will sacrifice his health <a name="Page_68"
       id="Page_68"></a>to over-smoking, to excess in athletics, to
       over-eating or champagne drinking, to late hours and
       overwork; but to sacrifice health or future happiness to
       save a woman from degradation, bah! it never so much as
       enters his mind. Even so high-minded a writer as Mr. Lecky,
       in his <i>History of European
       Morals</i>,<a name="FNanchor_9_9"
       id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"
       class="fnanchor">[9]</a> deliberately proposes that the
       difficulty of deferred marriage which advanced civilization
       necessitates, at least for the upper classes, should be met
       by temporary unions being permitted with a woman of a lower
       class. The daughters of workingmen, according to this
       writer, are good enough as fleshly stop-gaps, to be flung
       aside when a sufficient income makes the true wife
       possible&mdash;an honorable proceeding indeed! to say
       nothing of the children of such a temporary union, to whom
       the father can perform no duty, and leave no inheritance,
       save the inestimable one of a mother with a tainted name.
       Verily there must be some fault in our training of men!
       Certainly an intelligent American mother put her finger on
       the blot, so far as we are concerned, when, speaking to me
       many years ago, she said what struck her so in our English
       homes was the way in which the girls were subordinated to
       the boys; the boys seemed first considered, the girls in
       comparison were nowhere. Doubtless our English homes are
       more at fault here than in America; but, as a mother's pride
       in her boys is the same all over the world, may not even
       American <a name="Page_69"
       id="Page_69"></a>homes admit of a little improvement in this
       respect as well? And, if we choose to bring up our boys to
       look upon their mothers and sisters as more or less the
       devoted slaves of their selfishness, can we wonder that they
       should grow up to look upon all women as more or less the
       slaves of their needs, fleshly or otherwise?</p>

    <p>Now, what I want all boys taught from their earliest years
    is, roughly speaking, that boys came into the world to take
    care of girls. Whatever modification may take place in our view
    of the relation of the sexes, Nature's great fact will remain,
    that the man is the stronger&mdash;a difference which
    civilization and culture seem to strengthen rather than
    diminish; and from his earliest years he ought to be taught
    that he, therefore, is the one that has to serve. It is the
    strong that have to bear the burden of the weaker, and not to
    prostitute that strength by using it to master the weaker into
    bearing their loads. It is the man who has to give himself for
    the woman, not the other way on, as we have made it. Nay, this
    is no theory of mine; it is a truth implanted in the very heart
    of every true man. "Every true man," as Milton says, "is born a
    knight," diligently as we endeavor to stub up this royal root,
    constantly, as from the very nursery, we endeavor to train it
    out of him. You may deny the truth and go on some theory of
    your own in the training of your boys, but the truth cannot
    deny itself. It <a name="Page_70"
       id="Page_70"></a>is <i>there</i>, whether you will have it
       or not, a root of the tree of life itself.</p>

    <p>Now there is not a day that need pass without opportunities
    of training your boys in this their true knightly attitude. You
    can see, as I have already said, that they learn in relation to
    their own sisters what in after years they have to practise
    towards all women alike. To give up the comfortable easy-chair,
    the favorite book or toy, the warmest place by the fire, to the
    little sister&mdash;this ought to become a second nature to a
    well-trained boy. To carry a parcel for her, to jump up and
    fetch anything she wants, to give in to her because he is a boy
    and the stronger&mdash;all this ought to be a matter of course.
    As he grows older you can place him in little positions of
    responsibility to his sisters, sending them out on an
    expedition or to a party under his care. In a thousand such
    ways you can see that your boy is not only born but grows up a
    knight. I was once in a house where the master always brought
    up the heavy evening water-cans and morning coal-scuttles for
    the maids. And if these were placed at the foot of the stairs
    so as to involve no running in and out of the kitchen, it might
    be no mean exercise for a boy's muscles.</p>

    <p>I was told only the other day of a little six-year-old boy
    whose mother had brought him up from babyhood on these
    principles. He was playing with his little sister on a bed,
    when suddenly he perceived that she <a name="Page_71"
       id="Page_71"></a>was getting perilously near the edge which
       was farthest from the wall. Instantly he dismounted and went
       round to the other side, and, climbing up, pushed her gently
       into the middle of the bed, remarking sententiously to
       himself, "I think boys ought always to take the dangerous
       side of their sisters." Ah me! if only you mothers would but
       train your boys to "take the dangerous side of their
       sisters," especially of those poor little sisters who are
       thrust forth at so early an age to earn their own living,
       alone and unprotected, on the perilous highways of the
       world, skirted for them by so terrible a precipice, what a
       different world would it be for us women, what a purer and
       better world for your sons!</p>

    <p>Surely the womanhood in our homes ought to enable us to
    bring up our boys in such an habitual attitude of serving a
    woman, of caring for her, of giving himself for her, that it
    would become a moral impossibility for him ever to lower or
    degrade a woman in his after-life.</p>

    <p>In concluding these suggestions there is one point I must
    emphasize, the more so as in treating of one particular moral
    problem it is difficult not to seem to ignore a truth which is
    simply vital to all moral training. Let us clearly recognize
    that there is no such thing as moral specialism. Our moral
    being, like Wordsworth's cloud, "moveth altogether if it move
    at all." You cannot strengthen one particular virtue except by
    strengthening the character all round. Cardinal Newman points
    <a name="Page_72"
       id="Page_72"></a>out&mdash;I think in one of those wonderful
       Oxford sermons of his&mdash;that what our ancestors would
       have called "a bosom sin" will often take an underground
       course and come to the surface at quite an unexpected point
       in the character. Hidden licentiousness, which one would
       expect to evince itself in over-ripe sentiment and feeling,
       manifests itself instead in cruelty and hardness of heart.
       The little habit of self-indulgence which you in your
       foolish fondness have allowed in that boy of yours may, in
       after-life, come out as the very impurity which you have
       endeavored so earnestly to guard him against. This mystical
       interdependence and hidden correlation of our moral and
       intellectual being is a solemn thought, and can only be met
       by recognizing that the walls of the citadel must be
       strengthened at all points in order to resist the foe at
       one. Truthfulness, conscientiousness that refuses to scamp
       work, devotion to duty, temperance in food and drink,
       rectitude&mdash;these things are the bastions of purity of
       life, as well as of all high character.</p>

    <p>But in these days I think we have more especially to
    remember that the Beautiful Gate of all noble living rests,
    like the gate of the Jewish Temple, on two pillars, both of
    which show signs of being considerably out of repair. One of
    these pillars is obedience, or discipline. If you have not
    exacted prompt and unhesitating obedience in your boy, from his
    earliest childhood, to the parents whom he has seen, do you
    think that in after <a name="Page_73"
       id="Page_73"></a>years he will obey the Father of Lights,
       whom he has not seen? Do you think, if you have let him set
       your authority at defiance, he will in future years, with
       temptation on one side and opportunity on the other, bow to
       the invisible authority of conscience? What is it, I ask,
       that makes the army the finest school for character, giving
       us our Lawrences, our Havelocks, our Gordons, our
       Kitcheners, but simply this habit of implicit obedience, of
       that discipline which has grown so grievously lax in so many
       of our English homes? In Carlyle's strong words, "Obedience
       is our universal duty and destiny, wherein whoso will not
       bend must break: too early and too thoroughly we cannot be
       trained to know that 'would,' in this world of ours, is as
       mere zero to 'should,' and for most part as the smallest of
       fractions even to 'shall.'"<a name="FNanchor_10_10"
       id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
       class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

    <p>The second great pillar of the portal of noble life seems to
    me to show still greater signs of being out of repair and in
    want of restoration, and that pillar is reverence,&mdash;that
    heaven-eyed quality which Dr. Martineau rightly places at the
    very top of the ethical scale. Let that crumble, and the
    character which might have been a temple sinks into a mere
    counting-house. When in these days children are allowed to call
    their father Dick, Jack, or Tom, and nickname their own mother;
    when they are allowed to drown the voice of the most
    <a name="Page_74"
       id="Page_74"></a>honored guest at the table with their
       little bald chatter, so that even the cross-questioning
       genius of a Socrates would find itself at a discount; when
       they are allowed to criticise and contradict their elders in
       a way that would have appalled our grandmothers; when they
       are suffered to make remarks which are anything but reverent
       on sacred things&mdash;have I not some reason to fear that
       the one attribute which touches the character to fine issues
       is threatened with extinction? Do you think that the boy who
       has never been taught to reverence his own mother's
       womanhood will reverence the degraded womanhood of our
       streets, or hear that Divine Voice guarding all suffering
       manhood and all helpless womanhood from wrong at his hands,
       "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these, ye
       have done it unto Me?"</p>

    <p>Oh, I would entreat you to set yourself firmly against this
    evil tendency of our day, to which I cannot but believe so much
    of its agnosticism is due,&mdash;that deadening down and
    stamping out of the spiritual instincts of our nature, those
    great intuitions of the soul, which lie both above and below
    all reasoning and logic and form their basis rather than their
    apex. Once let the springs of reverence be choked up, once let
    that window of the soul be overgrown with weeds and cobwebs,
    and your most careful training will only produce a character
    estimable in many respects, but for the most part without noble
    aspirations, without high ideals, with no <a name="Page_75"
       id="Page_75"></a>great enthusiasms&mdash;a character, to use
       Saint Beuve's expressive phrase, "tout en façade sur la
       rue," whose moral judgments are no better than street cries;
       the type of man that accepts the degradation of women with
       blank alacrity as a necessity of civilization, and would
       have it regulated, like any other commodity for the market;
       that very common type of character which, whatever its good
       qualities, spreads an atmosphere of blight around it,
       stunting all upward growing things and flattening down our
       life to the dead level of desert sands.</p>

    <p>If you would not be satisfied at your boy rising no higher
    than this, then, again I say, guard the springs of reverence.
    Do not let your pride in your child's smartness or any
    momentary sense of humor make you pass over any little speech
    that savors of irreverence; check it instantly. Exact respect
    for yourself and for the boy's father, the respect which is no
    enemy, but the reverse, to the uttermost of fondness. Insist
    upon good manners and respectful attention to the guests of
    your house. Do not despise the good old fashion of family
    prayers because they do not rise to all that we might wish them
    to be. At least they form a daily recognition of "Him in whom
    the families of the earth are blessed"&mdash;a daily
    recognition which that keen observer of English life, the late
    American Ambassador, Mr. Bayard, pointed out as one of the
    great secrets of England's greatness, and which forms a
    valuable school for habits of reverence <a name="Page_76"
       id="Page_76"></a>and discipline for the children of the
       family. Insist upon the boys being down in time for the
       worship of God, and do not allow them to get into the habit
       indulged in by so many young men of "sloping" down with
       slippered feet long after breakfast is done and prayers are
       over.</p>

    <p>Only let the springs of reverence well up in your child's
    soul, and then, and then only, will you be able to give your
    boy what, after all, must always be the greatest safeguard from
    shipwreck in this perilous world&mdash;religious faith, that
    stops him at the very threshold of temptation with the words:
    "How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?" Your
    very attitude as you kneel by his side with bowed head and
    folded hands while he says his little evening and morning
    prayer will breathe into his soul a sense of a Divine Presence
    about our bed and about our path. Your love&mdash;so strong to
    love, and yet so weak to save&mdash;can lead his faltering
    childish feet to that Love which is deeper than our deepest
    fall, "which knows all, but loves us better than it knows." You
    can press your child against the very heart of God, and lay him
    in the Everlasting Arms, that faint not, neither are weary;
    and, with the mother of St. Augustine, you may know that the
    child of such prayers and such tears will never perish.</p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI"
       id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

    <h3>BOYHOOD AND SCHOOL LIFE</h3>

    <p>I now come to what must always be the great moral crux in a
    boy's life, that on which all the higher issues of his
    character will, in all human probability, turn&mdash;his school
    life. One of our great educators took what, looked at
    superficially, seemed the somewhat retrograde step of giving up
    the mastership of a college at Oxford to take again the
    head-mastership of a great public school. But in a conversation
    I had with him he led me to infer that he had done so from the
    conviction forced upon him that the whole moral trend of the
    character must be given, if given at all, prior to university
    life, at the public school; and to him nothing less than the
    formation of high moral character seemed worth striving for.
    Fine scholarship and high mathematics are excellent, but after
    all, as the apostle of culture, Matthew Arnold, has told us,
    conduct, and not intellectual attainment, forms seven-tenths of
    life.</p>

    <p>Now, it is in connection with your boy's school life that
    you will have your greatest dangers to face, your hardest
    battle to fight.</p>

    <p>I am, of course, aware that your school system is in
    <a name="Page_78"
       id="Page_78"></a>some respects different from ours. You have
       the mixed day school such as largely obtains in Scotland,
       but which does not exist, at least for the upper classes, in
       England. You have private boarding-schools, which with us
       are called preparatory schools, as they form the vestibule
       to the public school. And you have, lastly, a few large
       public schools somewhat on the model of Eton and Harrow.</p>

    <p>Let us begin with the boarding-school. I do not intend for
    one moment to deny the advantages of our great English public
    schools. They are excellent for discipline and the formation of
    strong character, especially for a ruling race like ours; and
    their very numerical strength and importance command a splendid
    set of men as masters. But both public and private
    boarding-schools labor under one great disadvantage: they
    remove a boy from all family influence and violate the order of
    our life, which can never be violated with impunity. Boys and
    girls are sent into the world in pretty equal proportions, and
    we were never intended to pile a lot of boys together without
    girls and largely without any feminine influence whatever. To
    do so is to insure moral disorder whether in our schools or
    yours. To quote from an excellent paper of Dr. Butler's: "In
    giving us sisters," says one of the Hares in <i>Guesses at
    Truth</i>, "God gave us the best moral antiseptic," and it is
    their absence more than anything else that has produced the
    moral problems which our <a name="Page_79"
       id="Page_79"></a>boarding-schools present. To be absent from
       sisters for the greater part of the year, at an age when
       their companionship is perhaps the most eloquent of silent
       appeals to purity, is undoubtedly one of the greatest evils
       to be set against the blessings of our public
       schools.<a name="FNanchor_11_11"
       id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"
       class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

    <p>For my own part, I can only say that the one thing which has
    filled me at times with the darkness of despair has not been
    the facts about our back streets, not those facts to meet which
    we hold conferences and establish penitentiaries, refuges,
    preventive homes, etc.&mdash;I am full of hopefulness about
    them&mdash;but the facts about our public, and still more about
    our private, schools, which until lately have been met with
    dead silence and masterly inactivity on the part of English
    parents. On the part of mothers I feel sure it is ignorance,
    not indifference: if they knew what I know, it simply could not
    be the latter. Even now, when some, at least, of their
    ignorance has been dispelled, I doubt whether they realize the
    depth of moral corruption which is to be found in our public
    and private schools; the existence of heathen vices which by
    the law of our land are treated as felony, and which we would
    fain hope, after nineteen centuries of Christianity, might now
    be relegated to the first chapter of Romans. They do not
    realize the presence of other and commoner forms of impurity,
    the self-defilement which taints the moral <a name="Page_80"
       id="Page_80"></a>nature and stimulates the lower nature into
       unhealthy and abnormal activity. They do not understand the
       essentially sporadic nature of the evil&mdash;that it may
       exist "as a pestilence that walketh in darkness" in one
       boarding-school, while another, owing to the influence of a
       good set of boys, is comparatively free from it; and they
       will, therefore, take a single denial of its existence,
       possibly from their own husbands, as conclusive. Even the
       affirmations of head-masters are not altogether to be
       trusted here, as mothers cannot betray the confidence of
       their own boys, and often fail in gaining their consent to
       let the head-master know what is going on, in the boy's
       natural dread of being found out as the source of the
       information and, according to the ruling code, cut, as
       having "peached." Once I obtained leave to expose an
       indescribable state of things which was going on in broad
       daylight in an unsupervised room at one of our great public
       schools, utterly unsuspected by the head-master, and his
       subordinate, the house-master. But another case which for
       long made my life a kind of waking nightmare remained
       unexposed to the last.</p>

    <p>Speaking of those commoner forms of impurity to which I have
    referred, and which are so mischievous as stimulating immature
    functions, needing, as Acton over and over again insists,
    absolute quiet and rest for healthy development, Dr. Dukes, the
    head physician of one of our best known public schools, states:
    "The <a name="Page_81"
       id="Page_81"></a>reason why it is so widespread an
       evil"&mdash;computed in 1886 at eighty per cent. of boys at
       school, a computation accepted by a committee of public
       schoolmasters&mdash;"I believe to be, that the boy leaves
       home in the first instance without one word of warning from
       his parents that he will meet with bad boys who will tell
       him that everybody does it, and thus he falls into evil ways
       from his innocence and ignorance
       alone."<a name="FNanchor_12_12"
       id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"
       class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

    <p>Dr. Dukes further states that as the results of his thirty
    years' experience he had come to the conclusion that only one
    per cent. of parents ever warned their boys at all before
    sending them to school.</p>

    <p>These statements were made some fifteen years ago, when
    first the conspiracy of silence was broken through and the
    question of the morality of our public and private schools was
    dragged into the light of day and boldly faced and grappled
    with, largely owing to the action of Dr. Pusey. Since then a
    mass of strenuous effort has been directed against the evil by
    our high-minded head-masters; and an immense improvement has
    been effected. It is too short a time for one to hope that the
    evil has been eradicated; but when parents learn to fulfil
    their moral duties of teaching and warning their own
    boys&mdash;as Dr. Dukes observes&mdash;I feel sure it could be
    so far removed as to cause the numbers to <a name="Page_82"
       id="Page_82"></a>change places, so that we might obtain a
       percentage of ninety to ninety-five of those who lead pure
       lives while at school, as against five per cent, who are
       impure, reversing the lamentable ratio that now exists. But
       here again there has been progress, and I feel sure that the
       percentage of parents who do warn and teach their sons
       before sending them to school is now incomparably higher
       than Dr. Dukes's "one per cent." and is steadily rising.</p>

    <p>As to other deeper and nameless evils, they have been
    already reduced to a minimum, and if fathers could only be
    persuaded to do their duty by their own boys, they might be
    made wholly to disappear.</p>

    <p>I give you these facts about our English schools, that
    parents may see for themselves what are the consequences of
    refusing both teaching and warning to their boys, under the
    delusion that God's lilies will grow up in the weedy garden of
    the human heart without strenuous culture and training.</p>

    <p>Do not, therefore, I beseech you, take for granted that your
    boarding-schools are entirely free from such evils. You have
    the same conditions that we have. Till lately your boys have
    been as untaught and unwarned as ours. In your
    boarding-schools, as in ours, they are removed from the
    purifying influence of mother and sisters. They are just at the
    age which has neither the delicacy of childhood nor of early
    manhood. Rest assured that conditions will breed like
    results.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_83"
       id="Page_83"></a></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"My belief, not lightly formed," says Dr.
        Butler,<a name="FNanchor_13_13"
           id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13"
           class="fnanchor">[13]</a> "is, that none of the great
           schools can congratulate themselves on anything like
           safety from this danger. And if this is true of the
           great public schools, it is still more true of private
           schools, where the evil is admittedly greater. Boys and
           masters alike may strangely deceive themselves; the evil
           may hide very close. Many a boy has been known to assert
           positively and honestly that nothing of the kind was
           ever heard of in his time, and that any fellow suspected
           of it would have been cut, and half killed, when all the
           time the evil was actively at work even among the circle
           of his intimate friends."</p>
    </div>

    <p>And yet it is this evil, so pervasive in its influence, so
    certain to taint the fresh springs of young life with impure
    knowledge, if not to foul them with unclean acts, that parents
    still too often elect to ignore. The boy, full of eager
    curiosity, anxious, above all things, to catch up the ways of
    the other fellows, afraid, above all things, of being laughed
    at for his innocence, and elated at being taken up by one of
    the swells in the shape of an elder boy, and at first set-off
    wholly ignorant of the motive; exposed to suggestions about the
    functions of his own body which he has not the knowledge to
    rebut as the devil's lies&mdash;what wonder is it that so many
    boys, originally good and pure, fall victims? "They blunder
    like blind puppies into sin," a medical man who has had much to
    do with boys' schools exclaimed to me in the bitterness of his
    soul. The small house of the young boy's soul, full of the song
    of birds, the fresh babble of the voices of sisters, all the
    innocent sights <a name="Page_84"
       id="Page_84"></a>and sounds of an English or American home,
       swept and garnished till now by such loving hands, but left
       empty, unguarded, and unwatched, for the unclean spirit to
       lift the latch and enter in and take possession&mdash;the
       pity of it! oh, the pity of it! What can the boy think? To
       quote Dr. Dukes again:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"He will say to himself: 'My father knows of all this
        vice at schools, and yet has not said one word to me about
        it. He has warned me about most things. He told me to be
        truthful, to keep my temper, to be upright and manly, to
        say my prayers; he pressed me never to get into debt, never
        to drink, and never to use bad language; and he told me I
        ought to change my boots and clothes when wet, so as not to
        get ill; and yet he has not said one syllable about this.
        My father is a good man and loves me, and if he wanted me
        not to do this he would surely have told me; it can't be
        very wrong, else I am sure he would have protected me and
        told me all about it."</p>
    </div>

    <p>I remember a friend of mine, who had been greatly stirred on
    the whole subject, endeavoring, with tears in her eyes, to
    persuade a father to warn his boy before sending him to his
    first public school, and on his absolutely refusing to do any
    such thing, she said to him, "At least promise me that you will
    give him this book," placing in his hands Mr. George Everett's
    excellent little book, <i>Your Innings</i>. This he consented
    to do. The next morning my friend met him at breakfast, the boy
    having been already despatched by an early train. "Well," he
    said, "I sat up till past twelve last night reading your book;
    it is excellent, and I gave it to my lad before starting him
    off. But <a name="Page_85"
       id="Page_85"></a>there is just one chapter in it, called a
       'Strange Companion,' which I took the precaution of
       previously cutting out with my penknife; and my boy in his
       after years will thank me for not putting any such ideas in
       his head, but having kept him the pure and innocent lad that
       he is." I need not say that it was the one chapter that
       would have put the boy on his guard. Oh, befooled and
       purblind father! I happened to know that the school to which
       the boy was sent was swept at that time by a moral epidemic,
       and before that hapless lad had been a week in its corrupt
       atmosphere he would have had ideas put into his head with a
       vengeance. His father had handed over the ground of his
       boy's heart for the devil to sow the first crop, and as a
       rule the devil sows, not wild oats, as we say, but
       acorns&mdash;a dread sowing which it may take years to root
       up and to extirpate, even if, so far as after-taint is
       concerned, it can ever be wholly extirpated.</p>

    <p>In another case a widowed mother came to one of my meetings,
    and was profoundly alarmed at what I said about the dangers of
    our schoolboys. It had never occurred to her that her
    gentlemanly little lad of twelve could have any temptations of
    the kind. Unlike the father I have mentioned, she resolved to
    speak to him that same evening. She found that he was fighting
    a battle against the whole school, standing up alone for the
    right, guided by some blind instinct of purity to resist the
    foul suggestions which were inflicted upon <a name="Page_86"
       id="Page_86"></a>him, threatening him with the most terrible
       consequences in after-life if he did not yield and do as the
       other boys did. Think of it, ye mothers! a child of twelve
       without a hand to guide him, without a voice to cheer him,
       refused the knowledge that would have saved him from his
       deadly peril, his own mother deaf and dumb and blind to his
       struggles, leaving him to fight his little forlorn hope
       absolutely alone. I need scarcely say how thankfully he
       poured forth his sore heart to his mother when once she had
       opened the door, till now kept locked by her own ignorance;
       and how she was able to explain to him that, far from
       reaping any evil consequences from doing what is right, like
       Sir Galahad, "his strength would be the strength of ten" if
       he kept himself pure. She probably took steps to remove him
       from so corrupt an atmosphere as prevailed in that
       preparatory school, but of this I do not know.</p>

    <p>But here let me guard myself from being misunderstood. I am
    not making out that every schoolboy is exposed to these
    temptations; there are boys so exceptionally endowed that they
    seem to spread a pure atmosphere around them which is respected
    by even the coarsest and loosest boys in the school. All I do
    maintain, with Dr. Butler, is that no school is safe from this
    danger, that at any time it may prove an active one in your
    boy's life, and that at the very least you have to guard him
    from impure knowledge being <a name="Page_87"
       id="Page_87"></a>thrust upon him before nature has developed
       the instincts of manhood by which she guards her inner
       shrine.</p>

    <p>And now I come to the question of day schools. As I have
    already said, I cannot feel but they are more consonant with
    the order of our life as giving the discipline and competition
    of numbers without removing the boy from family life, nor do
    they lend themselves to some of the graver evils of our
    boarding-schools. But, alas! in themselves they form no panacea
    for the evils we are contemplating. On the contrary, I am told
    on authority I cannot question that in some places this plague
    spot is rife among them. In one case the evil had struck so
    wide and deep that the school had to be temporarily closed.
    Here, again, the same lesson is emphasized, viz.: that whatever
    is the form of the school, however excellent the teacher, there
    is no substitute in the moral life for the home teaching and
    training of mothers and fathers.</p>

    <p>No mother can read these statements
    unmoved&mdash;statements, remember, not my own, but made by men
    of the deepest and widest experience, and which, therefore, you
    are bound to weigh, ponder, and carefully consider. I know that
    straight from your heart again comes the cry, "What can I
    do?"</p>

    <p>I am inclined to answer this cry in one word,
    "Everything,"&mdash;with God's help.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_88"
       id="Page_88"></a></p>

    <h4>I</h4>

    <p>And now let us enter into practical details. We will begin
    with the outworks, and work our way inwards to the shrine.</p>

    <p>First, as to the all-important choice of a school, should
    the boy's father decide, for reasons in which you concur to
    send him to a boarding-school.</p>

    <p>As to how to ascertain the real state of a school there is,
    of course, considerable difficulty. I have always found the
    best way is through mothers who have gained the confidence of
    their boys and who know through them what really goes on. In
    this way, as mothers wake up to the danger their boys run and
    to their own responsibility in guarding them, we shall be able
    to help one another more and more. But make a point of
    yourself, as well as the boy's father, personally seeing the
    master to whom you think of entrusting your lad, and talking
    over the matter with him. In this way you will not only satisfy
    yourself, but you will strengthen his hands by making him feel
    how vital the whole question is to your heart. What more than
    anything else weakens the high-minded men who have the tuition
    of the young is the utter unconcern that is evinced by the
    parents and the sense that, by the payment of a sum of money
    down, they can compound with a master for the performance of
    their inalienable duty of undertaking the moral education of
    their own children.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_89"
       id="Page_89"></a>Here let me give you two most earnest
       cautions. Do not attach too much importance to mere
       mechanical arrangements as moral safeguards. One of our most
       successful head-masters says:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"I would most seriously warn any parent anxious about
        the choice of a school not to attach much weight to the
        apparent excellence of arrangements. Some of the worst
        schools have these arrangements in the highest perfection.
        They cannot afford to have them otherwise. Neat cubicles
        and spotless dimity have beguiled an uninterrupted sequence
        of mammas, and have kept alive, and even flourishing,
        schools which are in a thoroughly bad moral state and are
        hopelessly inefficient in every particular. Of course, many
        a parent feels that he ought to judge for himself, and
        these mechanical arrangements are too often the only
        material on which he can form his judgment. Let me assure
        him that they are entirely untrustworthy."</p>
    </div>

    <p>Secondly, do not think to find safety in the choice of a
    so-called "religious" school, even though it reflect the exact
    shade of your own religious opinions. The worst evils I ever
    knew went on in a school where the boys implicated held a
    weekly prayer-meeting! We must boldly face the fact that there
    is some mysterious connection between the religious emotions
    and the lower animal nature; and the religious forcing-house,
    of whatever school of theology, will always be liable to prove
    a hot-bed of impurity. Choose a school with a high moral tone,
    with religion as an underlying principle&mdash;a practical
    religion, that inculcates duty rather than fosters emotion, and
    embodies the wise proverb of Solomon, "In all labor there is
    profit, but the talk of the lips tendeth to penury."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_90"
       id="Page_90"></a>Only let me beseech you to use your whole
       influence not to have your boy sent away at too early an
       age. Do you really think that the exclusive society of
       little boys, with their childish chatter, their foolish
       little codes, their crude and often ridiculously false
       notions of life, and their small curiosities, naturally
       inquisitive, but not always clean in the researches they
       inspire, and <i>always</i> false in their results, is
       morally better for your child than, in Dr. Butler's
       words,</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"the refining and purifying atmosphere of home, with the
        tenderness of a mother, the grace and playfulness of
        sisters, the love and loyalty of the family nurse, and
        lastly&mdash;scarcely to be distinguished in its effects
        from these influences&mdash;the sweetness, the simplicity,
        the flower-picking, the pony-patting of happy, frolicsome
        younger brothers or sisters in the garden, the paddock, or
        stable?"</p>
    </div>

    <p>If the boy has got out of hand, I ask, Whose fault is that?
    and is it fair to the child that your fault should be remedied
    by sending him away from all that is best and most purifying in
    child life? I would plead earnestly that eleven or twelve is
    old enough for the private school, and that a boy should not be
    sent to a public school before fourteen. In this I think most
    of our English head-masters would agree with me. Till this age,
    a day school or a tutor should be had recourse to, and when the
    time comes for sending him off to school, at least we can
    refuse to place the boy anywhere, either at a private or public
    school, where there is not some woman to mother and look after
    the boys <a name="Page_91"
       id="Page_91"></a>and exert a good womanly influence over
       them. A head-master keenly alive to moral dangers, with a
       capable wife ready to use her womanly influence in aiding
       and abetting his efforts, I have found the best possible
       combination.</p>

    <p>But if it is decided that the boys are to be brought up at
    the day school, your range of choice will probably be very
    small. You will have to look wholly to your home influence and
    teaching to counteract any evil influence they may encounter in
    their school life. But as your boys will never be separated
    from you, what may not that home influence and teaching, with
    knowledge and forewarning to direct it,&mdash;what may it not
    accomplish?</p>

    <h4>II</h4>

    <p>Let us, then, think out the best ways in which you can warn
    and guard your boy and fulfil your responsibility of being his
    moral teacher.</p>

    <p>Let us begin with the simplest measure which you can take,
    and which can present no difficulty to anyone. Before sending
    your boy to school get him quietly by himself and say to him
    some such words as these: "My boy, you know, or will come to
    know, that when boys get together they often talk of nasty
    things, and even do nasty things. Give me your word of honor as
    a Christian and a gentleman that you will never say or do
    anything that you know you would be <a name="Page_92"
       id="Page_92"></a>ashamed to tell me, that you know would
       bring a blush to your sister's cheeks. Always remember that
       dirty talk, and still more dirty deeds, are only fit for
       cads. Promise me faithfully that you will never let any boy,
       especially an elder boy, tell you 'secrets.' If you were to
       consent through curiosity, or because you feel flattered at
       one of the elder fellows taking you up, be sure he means you
       no good. Whatever you want to know ask me, and so far as I
       can I will tell you." Some such words as these said solemnly
       to a boy the day before he leaves home for the first time,
       either for a boarding-school, or even a day school, will
       make your womanhood a sort of external conscience to your
       boy, to guard him from those first beginnings of impurity,
       in the shape of what are technically called "secrets," which
       lead on to all the rest. I know one mother who, from her
       boy's earliest years, has made a solemn pact with him, on
       the one hand, if he would promise never to ask any questions
       about life and birth of anyone but her, she, in her turn,
       would promise to tell him all he wanted to know; and from
       first to last there has been that perfect confidence and
       friendship between mother and son which is, and ever must
       be, a boy's greatest safeguard.</p>

    <p>Only remember that with young boys men who have had the
    greatest experience are generally agreed that it is better not
    to put the stress on religious motives. Practically, for a
    young boy, it is better to treat the <a name="Page_93"
       id="Page_93"></a>whole thing as dirty, nasty, and
       blackguardly. And the whole subject must always be spoken of
       with reserve, without any emotion, and with much "dry
       light."</p>

    <p>With most lads I should go a step further; I should give the
    boy one of the White Cross papers, "A Strange
    Companion."<a name="FNanchor_14_14"
       id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14"
       class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It is impossible to lay down hard
       and fast rules; it is impossible to make so many jam-pots of
       even young humanity, to be tied up and labelled and arranged
       upon the same shelf. Each individuality has to be dealt with
       in all its mysterious idiosyncrasy. One boy may be so
       reserved that it is better to write to him than to talk face
       to face; another may find the greatest possible strength and
       comfort in freedom of speech and the feeling that there is
       no barrier between him and his mother with regard to being
       able to tell her freely of any temptations that may assail
       him. Your mother's instincts will be your best guide as to
       what method to adopt with each of your boys.</p>

    <p>If the father of the lad can be induced, at any rate before
    he enters a boarding-school, to follow the advice of that
    remarkable man, Mr. Thring, the founder of Uppingham School, in
    his address to our Church Congress, and write a letter of plain
    warning and counsel to the lad, it would be an unspeakable
    help. "My <a name="Page_94"
       id="Page_94"></a>first statement," says Mr. Thring, "is that
       all fathers ought to write such a letter to their sons. It
       is not difficult, if done in a common-sense
       way."<a name="FNanchor_15_15"
       id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"
       class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

    <p>But now I come to what on all hands we must allow to be a
    point of extreme difficulty. I think all head-masters, deeply
    concerned in the moral welfare of the boys under their charge,
    would emphatically endorse the following words of Dr.
    Butler's:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"It is certain, it must needs be, that boys should, at
        an early period of their boyhood, come to hear of the
        nature of sexual relations. From whom should they first
        learn it? Should it be with every accompaniment of
        coarseness, of levity, of obscenity? From some ribald groom
        in the stables? From some impure maidservant who has stolen
        into the household and the nursery? From some brother only
        a year or two older, who has just received his first
        initiation in impurity at a private school and is too young
        to understand its danger? Worst of all, from the idlest,
        and most corrupt, and most worthless set of boys at this
        same private school, who surround the newcomer within a few
        days, perhaps a few hours, of his first joining, and, with
        knowing looks and enticing words, try to probe his childish
        knowledge, and leave him half-ashamed of himself and keenly
        inquisitive for full initiation, if he finds that he knows
        nothing of this engrossing mystery? Is it right, is it
        fair, is it consistent with religious duty or with
        common-sense, that a little boy of eight, or ten, or
        twelve, should be sent at this impressionable age to hear
        for the first time of facts of human nature which must ere
        long be known, and are part of God's appointment? Does not
        every dictate of humanity and of reason point to the
        conclusion that the dawn of this knowledge should be
        invested with all that is tender, and loving, and pure, and
        sacred, instead of being shrouded in the mists of innuendo
        or blazoned forth in <a name="Page_95"
           id="Page_95"></a>the shamelessness of bestiality? There
           is really no answer but one to such a question, and the
           plain truth is that fathers, perhaps still more mothers,
           must recognize the duty which lies upon them to teach
           their children, at such times, in such words, and with
           such reservations as the character of each child may
           suggest, the elements at least of that knowledge which
           will otherwise be learnt but a very little later from a
           widely different set of instructors. I lay down the
           principle as admitting of no exception&mdash;I do not
           anticipate even one dissentient voice from any who now
           hear me&mdash;<i>that no boy ought ever to be allowed to
           go to school without learning from his father or his
           mother, or from some brother or tried friend
           considerably older than himself the simple facts as to
           the laws of birth and the terrible danger of ever coming
           to talk of these phenomena as matters of frivolous and
           filthy conversation</i>."</p>
    </div>

    <p>I can only beseech you to give due weight to these words of
    one who had many years' experience of a large public school.
    Over and over again, at all my meetings of educated mothers, I
    have reiterated his question in similar words, "Is it right, is
    it fair, that your boy should learn the sacred mysteries of
    life and birth from the sources which Dr. Butler enumerates,
    and to which you abandon him, if you refuse to speak; sources
    of unclean and lying information by which I have no hesitation
    in saying that the mind and conscience of many men are more or
    less permanently defiled, even when the life has been kept
    outwardly pure?" Can you hesitate for one moment to allow that
    the springs of the life which you will be the first to
    acknowledge comes from God should well up from a pure source,
    till, like Wordsworth's stream&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p><a name="Page_96"
               id="Page_96"></a></p><span class="i6">"Crowned with
               flowers,<br /></span> <span class="i0">The mountain
               infant to the sun laughs forth,"<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and that the whole subject should be so bound up in the
    boy's mind with his father's love for his mother, his mother's
    love for his father, with his own existence, and that of his
    sisters, that he would shrink with utter loathing from the
    filthy so-called "secrets" that are bandied about among
    schoolboys? I know that the task of conveying this knowledge
    presents many difficulties, but again I ask, "What is there in
    our life that is worth doing which is not difficult?" Long ago
    the definition of a difficulty to me has become "a thing to be
    overcome." It is not in sitting down helplessly before a
    difficulty that the way will open. With us, as with the
    Israelites on the brink of that raging midnight sea, it is in a
    brave obedience to the Divine command, "Go forward!" that the
    path opens through the trackless sea, and we find that the
    great waters that seem ready to overwhelm us are in reality a
    baptism into new life.</p>

    <h4>III</h4>

    <p>Again I seem almost to hear the cry of your heart, "I know I
    ought to speak to my boy, but how am I to do it?"</p>

    <p>Now, it is here that I earnestly desire to give you, if I
    possibly can, some helpful, practical suggestions,
    <a name="Page_97"
       id="Page_97"></a>for I feel that it is not in the
       recognition of a duty, but in its performance, that the
       difficulty lies which is arresting so many educated mothers
       at the present time.</p>

    <p>With very young children, whether girls or boys, there
    should be no difficulty whatever. They are too young to
    understand. Only, when they come to you asking their innocent
    little questions as to where the little baby brother or sister
    comes from, I would earnestly ask you never to allow yourself,
    or your nurse, to inflict on them the usual popular fables,
    that the baby was brought by the doctor or that it was found
    under the gooseberry-bush. A child is far quicker than we think
    to detect that mother is hiding something, and the first tiny
    seed of evil curiosity is sown. Make no mystery about it; look
    your child full in the face, and say, "My child, you have asked
    me a question about what is very, very sacred. If I were to try
    to explain it to you, you would not be old enough to
    understand; for the present you must be content to know that
    the baby comes from God; how it comes mother will tell you when
    you grow old enough to understand; only promise me that you
    will never ask any one but mother about it." The child will
    then see that you are hiding nothing, and will be satisfied to
    wait for the explanation that mother has promised.</p>

    <p>But what when the child is old enough to
    understand?&mdash;an age which doubtless varies in different
    children, but which with boys must come before their first
    school, <a name="Page_98"
       id="Page_98"></a>if you are to occupy the ground of his
       heart with good seed, which leaves no room for the devil's
       sowing.</p>

    <p>Well, with regard to the facts of birth, I do not think we
    ought to find much difficulty. You can point out how the baby
    seed has a soft, downy place provided for it in the pod of the
    parent plant till it has ripened and is fit to be sown, when
    the pod opens and lets it fall to the earth, and it becomes a
    plant in its turn. You can point out that the egg in a similar
    way is carried in the mother bird's body till the shell has
    hardened and is fit to be laid, when she warms it with her own
    breast, patiently sitting on it for days, while the father bird
    feeds her, till the little chick is strong enough to break the
    walls of its tiny house, and come forth and peck and fend for
    itself. You can explain how the little kitten the child plays
    with has in the same way a safe place provided for it in the
    mother's body, where it grows and grows till all its organs are
    formed, and it can breathe and suck, when, like the seed from
    the pod, and the chick from the egg it leaves the mother's
    body, and is born, a blind and helpless baby kitten, to be fed
    and tenderly cared for by the mother cat. You will explain that
    the baby comes in just the same way so far as its infant body
    is concerned, growing like the kitten from a tiny
    cell&mdash;borne by the mother till all the organs are formed
    which it needs for its earthly life, when it also is born and
    laid in its mother's arms, to be nourished and cared for by the
    love of both father <a name="Page_99"
       id="Page_99"></a>and mother, not for a few weeks, as with
       animals, but through long years of helplessness. And you
       mean to tell me that the sacred truth would not endear you
       to your child far more than the usual cock-and-bull story
       about the doctor and the gooseberry-bush?</p>

    <p>A friend of mine has three boys of widely opposite character
    and temperament. Owing to circumstances, the eldest lad had to
    be sent to school at an early age. Young as he was, she
    resolved to follow Dr. Butler's advice and tell him the facts
    of birth in the way I have suggested. On realizing the truth,
    the boy flung his arms round her neck and burst into tears. But
    though she felt that she had done right, she was not wholly
    without misgivings that she might have introduced some
    objectionable talk into her nursery. When the time came to send
    the second lad to school, she repeated the talk that she had
    had with his elder brother. But to her surprise she found him
    in total ignorance of the facts: his elder brother had never
    confided them to him. And so again with the third boy.
    Evidently the boys had considered it too sacred a thing to talk
    about&mdash;how much too sacred, then, to allow of their
    joining in with the unclean gossip of schoolboys! Its only
    result was to give them an added tenderness for their mother,
    and to make them resent all such unclean talk as so much mud
    flung at her.</p>

    <p>So far, so good. But we all of us realize that it is not the
    facts of birth, but the facts of the origination
    <a name="Page_100"
       id="Page_100"></a>of life, that form the perennial source of
       obscene talk, and often of obscene action, among boys; and
       it is in explaining these, without violating those instincts
       of reserve and modesty with which nature herself surrounds
       the whole subject, that what often seems an insuperable
       difficulty arises. Yet these functions are, and must be, the
       very shrine of a body which is a temple of the Lord and
       Giver of life; and on the face of things, therefore, there
       must be some method of conveying pure knowledge to the
       opening mind with regard to them. The difficulty must be
       with ourselves, and not in the very nature of things
       themselves.</p>

    <p>Has it not been created in a great measure by a wrong
    method? We begin with human life instead of ending with it; we
    isolate it from a great system to which it belongs, and treat
    what is "the roof and crown of things" as a roof that tops no
    fair edifice, and is therefore anomalous; as a crown that rests
    on a head which has been severed from its body, and is
    therefore unmeaning. We obstinately refuse to live&mdash;to
    quote Goethe's words again&mdash;not only "in the beautiful and
    the good," but also "in the whole," which is equally necessary
    for a well-ordered life. What it seems to me we need is to
    teach the facts of life-giving, or, in other words, of sex, as
    a great, wide, open-air law, running right through animated
    creation, an ever-ascending progression forming a golden ladder
    leading up to man.</p>

    <p>In explaining the facts of reproduction, I would
    <a name="Page_101"
       id="Page_101"></a>therefore suggest that you should begin
       with the lowest rung of the ladder, the simplest organisms,
       such as the amoeba or the volvox. I should show how these
       multiply by fission, the creature dividing into two, when it
       is impossible to tell which is the father and which is the
       mother. I would then pass upwards to more complex organisms,
       where two individuals are required to form the offspring.
       You could explain the whole process by the method of
       fertilization in plants, as urged in an excellent paper by a
       lady doctor, published in the <i>Parents'
       Review</i>.<a name="FNanchor_16_16"
       id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16"
       class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Let me quote her words:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"The child can learn the difference of the names, color,
        and forms of flowers as soon as it can learn anything. The
        next step would be to simple lessons in the different parts
        of a plant&mdash;the vegetative organs of roots, stem,
        leaves, passing on to the reproductive organs in the
        flower&mdash;calyx, corolla, stamen, and pistil. Let the
        child be taught to notice that all flowers have not quite
        the same organs, some bearing stamens only, which shed the
        powdery pollen and are the male, or little father flowers;
        while others have the pistil only, furnished with the
        stigma to catch the pollen, and are the females, or little
        mothers; that the one sort of flowers is necessary to the
        other in producing the little seed or baby plant."</p>
    </div>

    <p>Let us take a primrose. Here the mother and father elements
    are found in the same flower. At the base of the flower, packed
    in a delicate casket, which is called the ovary, lie a number
    of small white objects no larger than butterfly-eggs. These are
    the eggs or ova of the primrose. Into this casket, by a secret
    opening, <a name="Page_102"
       id="Page_102"></a>filmy tubes thrown out by the pollen
       grains&mdash;now enticed from their hiding-place on the
       stamens and clustered on the stigma&mdash;enter and pour a
       fertilizing fluid, called "spermatozoa," through a
       microscopic gateway, which opens in the wall of the egg and
       leads to its inmost heart. The ovule, or future seed, is now
       fertilized and capable of producing a future primrose.
       Covered with many protecting coats, it becomes a perfect
       seed. The original casket swells, hardens, is transformed
       into a rounded capsule or seed-vessel, opening by valves or
       a deftly constructed hinge. One day this seed-vessel,
       crowded with seeds, breaks open and completes the cycle of
       reproduction by dispersing them over the ground, where they
       sow themselves, and grow and become primrose plants in their
       turn, starring the grass with their lovely
       blossoms.<a name="FNanchor_17_17"
       id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17"
       class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

    <p>Sometimes the male and female elements grow upon different
    plants, as in the catkins children are so fond of gathering in
    the spring.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"More than two thousand years ago Herodotus observed a
        remarkable custom in Egypt. At a certain season of the year
        the Egyptians went into the desert, cut off branches from
        the wild palms, and bringing them back to their gardens,
        waved them over the flowers of the date-palm. Why they
        performed this ceremony they did not know; but they knew
        that if they neglected it the date-crop would be poor or
        wholly lost. But the <a name="Page_103"
           id="Page_103"></a>true reason is now explained.
           Palm-trees, like human beings, are male and female. The
           garden plants, the date bearers, were females, the
           desert plants were males; and the waving of the branches
           over the females meant the transference of the pollen
           dust from the one to the other."<a name="FNanchor_18_18"
           id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18"
           class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>From these two elements, the spermatozoa, or male element,
    and the ova, or female element, all life, except in the lowest
    organisms, is produced.</p>

    <p>You could point out how it is by this marvellous process of
    reproduction, not only that the world is made green and
    beautiful, but all animal life is fed. Corn and rice, which are
    only fertilized seeds, form the staple food of a large
    proportion of mankind; while even the animal in order to live
    has first to be nourished on corn or grass before it can become
    meat for man.</p>

    <p>You could go on further to illustrate the facts of
    reproduction by bees and ants, so familiar to children, where
    the drone or male bee, or the male ant, in just the same way as
    in the plant, fertilizes the eggs of the queen bee or ant by
    bringing the spermatozoa into contact with the unfertilized egg
    in the insect's body, when the eggs thus fertilized are laid
    and carefully nurtured by the working bee or ant. All children
    have observed the little neuter,<a name="FNanchor_19_19"
       id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19"
       class="fnanchor">[19]</a> or working ant, carrying in its
       mandibles an egg almost as large as itself with an air of
       <a name="Page_104"
       id="Page_104"></a>extreme hurry and absorption, to lay it in
       the sun till the warmth hatches it into a baby ant.</p>

    <p>If it were further pointed out that not the male, but the
    female, as the mother of the species, is Nature's chief care;
    that among ants the male is sent into the world so imperfectly
    endowed that he cannot even feed himself, but is fed by his
    female relations, and that as soon as he has performed his
    function of fertilizing the queen ant, Nature apparently
    dismisses him with contemptuous starvation; or&mdash;to take
    the case of the drone or male bee&mdash;he is stung to death by
    the workers, it might help to modify the preposterous
    pretensions of the male, especially of the boy, in higher
    circles.</p>

    <p>You could then pass upwards through fish with the soft and
    hard roe, or male and female elements which are familiar to
    children, and through frogs with their spawn to birds. Here
    comes in an upward step indeed. "A world that only cared for
    eggs becomes," as Professor Drummond observes in his <i>Ascent
    of Man,</i> "a world that cares for its young." The first faint
    trembling dawn, or at least shadowing forth, of a moral life,
    in the care of the strong for the weak, makes itself seen,
    which henceforth becomes as pervasive an element in Nature as
    the fierce struggle for existence in which the weak are
    destroyed by the strong.<a name="FNanchor_20_20"
       id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"
       class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

    <p><a name="Page_105"
       id="Page_105"></a>In the bird&mdash;till now "the free queen
       of the air," living at her own wild will, suddenly fettered
       and brooding on her nest, and covering her helpless young
       with her tender wings&mdash;we see some faint image of the
       Divine tenderness. In the ceaseless toil of both the parent
       birds from morning till night to fill the little gaping
       throats we begin to feel the duty of the strong to serve and
       protect the weak; and in the little hen partridge, still
       clinging to her nest, when the flash of the scythe is
       drawing nearer and nearer, till reapers have told me they
       have feared the next sweep of the scythe might cut off her
       head, we see more than a shadow of that mother's love which
       is stronger than death. And when we pass lastly to the
       highest order of animals, the mammalia, we find them named
       after the mother's function of giving suck to her young from
       her own breast. They are no longer matured in an external
       egg, but are borne in her own body till they are able to
       breathe, and seek their nourishment from <a name="Page_106"
       id="Page_106"></a>her, and then they are born so helpless
       that, as with kittens and puppies, they often cannot even
       see.</p>

    <p>In this higher order of animals nothing can exceed the
    devotion of the mother to her young in their helpless infancy.
    The fierce bear will recklessly expose her shaggy breast to the
    hunter in their defence. Here, too, we find, as the Duke of
    Argyle points out in his book on <i>The Unity of
    Nature</i>,</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"that the equality of the sexes, as regards all the
        enjoyments as well as the work of life, is the universal
        rule; and among those of them in which the social instincts
        have been especially implanted, and whose systems of polity
        are like the most civilized polities of men, the females of
        the race are treated with a strange mixture of love,
        loyalty, and devotion."</p>
    </div>

    <p>"Man" as the Duke says, "is the Great Exception," and has
    been defined as the only animal that ill-treats and degrades
    his female.</p>

    <p>And when at length we come to the topmost step, "the roof
    and crown of things,"&mdash;Man, as you have already explained
    the physical facts of life-giving on the plane of plants, and
    ants, and bees, where they can excite no feeling of any kind,
    you will have no need to go over them again, but will find
    yourself free to express the physical in terms of the moral.
    Man, as a spiritual being, incarnate in an animal body, takes
    this great law of sex which we have seen running through the
    animated creation, and lifts it into the moral and the
    spiritual. The physical love which in animals only
    <a name="Page_107"
       id="Page_107"></a>lasts for the brief time that is needed
       for the production and rearing of offspring&mdash;becomes in
       him a love which "inhabiteth eternity," and unites him to
       the mother of his children in the indissoluble union of
       marriage. His fatherhood becomes the very representative of
       the Father in heaven. The mother becomes the very type and
       image of the Love that has loved us with more than a
       mother's love, borne with us with more than a mother's
       patience, suffered for us, in the Cross and Passion, more
       than a mother's pangs, to bring us into a higher life. The
       love of brothers and sisters becomes the first faint
       beginning of the universal Church and the brotherhood of
       man; and the sweet babble of their voices grows choral at
       length in the songs of the Church triumphant, the unbroken
       family in heaven; while the Christian home shadows forth the
       eternal home which awaits us
       hereafter.<a name="FNanchor_21_21"
       id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21"
       class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

    <p>The only warning you would have to give your boy would be to
    point out that, as a cathedral takes longer to build than a
    shanty, so the human body, which is meant to be the temple of
    the "Lord and Giver of life," takes much longer to mature than
    an animal's. Many an animal lives and dies of old age in the
    fourteen years that leave man still an immature boy. And you
    must earnestly impress upon him that the whole of this part
    <a name="Page_108"
       id="Page_108"></a>of his nature which you have been
       explaining to him as a great law running through animated
       creation and finding its highest uses in Man, must be left
       to mature itself in absolute rest and quiet. All premature
       use of it is fatal to perfect health of soul and body. The
       less he thinks of it, and the more he thinks of his work and
       his athletics, the better for him. Above all, you hope, now
       that he knows the truth and his curiosity is satisfied, he
       will loathe all filthy jests and stories about that which is
       the source of all beautiful living things on the pleasant
       earth and, in his own little world, of all happy family life
       and innocent home love and joy.</p>

    <p>Let me quote here, in conclusion, a little poem, called "The
    Golden Ladder," which seems to me to embody some of the
    teaching of this exquisite page of the illuminated Word of
    Creation, which man has so blotted and defiled with his
    obscenities, but which to "open hearts and love-lit eyes" is
    the spring of all that is highest&mdash;the birth of the moral
    and the cradle of the divine.</p>

    <p>Possibly you will say at once, "Oh, my boy has no taste for
    natural history, and he would take no interest in this kind of
    thing." All the better his finding it a bit dry&mdash;it will
    rid the subject of some of its dangerous attraction. I have yet
    to find the boy for whom the Latin Grammar has the least
    interest; but we do not excuse him on that ground from grinding
    at it. Whether he takes an interest in it or not, you have to
    teach him that he has got to know about these things before
    going to school, to guard him from the danger of having all
    sorts of false, and often foul, notions palmed off on him. I do
    not say that pure knowledge will necessarily save, but I do say
    that the pitcher which is full of clear spring-water has no
    room for foul. I do say that you have gained a great step, if
    in answer to the offer of enlightenment which he is certain to
    receive, you have enabled your boy to acquit himself of
    <a name="Page_111"
       id="Page_111"></a>the rough objurgation&mdash;forgive me for
       putting it in schoolboy language: "Oh, hold your jaw! I know
       all about that, and I don't want any of your rot." I do say
       that early associations are most terribly strong, and if you
       will secure that those early associations with regard to
       life and birth shall be bound up with all the sanctities of
       life&mdash;with home, with his mother, with family, with all
       that is best and highest in life; then his whole attitude in
       life will be different. But if these early associations are
       linked with all that is false and foul, some subtle odor of
       the sewer will still cling about the heart of the shrine, a
       nameless sense of something impure in the whole subject; an
       undefinable something in his way of looking at it, which has
       often made the purity of men&mdash;blameless in their outer
       life&mdash;- sadden and perplex me almost as much as the
       actions and words of confessedly impure men.</p>

    <h4>IV</h4>

    <p>But, whatever is the importance I attach to pure teaching, I
    return to my old position, that purity is an attitude of soul,
    or, perhaps I ought to say, the "snowy bloom" of the soul's
    perfect health, rather than anything you can embody in moral
    maxims or pure knowledge&mdash;that perfect bloom of spiritual
    health which may be as much the result of a mother's watchful
    care and training as the physical health of the body. It is for
    you to train your boy in that knightly attitude of soul,
    <a name="Page_112"
       id="Page_112"></a>that reverence for womanhood, which is to
       men as "fountains of sweet water" in the bitter sea of life;
       that chivalrous respect for the weak and the unprotected
       which, next to faith in God, will be the best guard to all
       the finer issues of his character. Truth of truth are the
       golden words of Ruskin to young men:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"Whomsoever else you deceive, whomsoever else you
        injure, whomsoever else you leave unaided, you must not
        deceive, nor injure, nor leave unaided according to your
        power any woman whatever, of whatever rank. Believe me,
        every virtue of the highest phase of manly character begins
        and ends in this, in truth and modesty before the face of
        all maidens, in truth and reverence or truth and pity to
        all womanhood."</p>
    </div>

    <p>Can we doubt or question this, we who worship Him who came
    to reveal the true man quite as much as to reveal the only true
    God&mdash;the real manhood beneath the false, perishable man
    with which it is so often overlaid by the influence of society
    and the world? Look at His attitude towards women, ay, even
    Eastern women, who had not been ennobled by centuries of
    Christian freedom and recognized equality of the sexes, but
    who, on the contrary, belonged to a nation tainted to some
    degree with that Eastern contempt for women which made a Hindu
    answer the question of the Englishman, perplexed by the
    multiplied of Indian gods and sects, "Is there <i>no</i> point
    of belief in which you all unite?" "Oh, yes," the Pundit
    replied, "we all believe in the sanctity of cows and the
    depravity of women!"</p>

    <p><a name="Page_113"
       id="Page_113"></a>These Eastern women, therefore, had much
       to enslave and lower them; but see how instantly they rose
       to the touch of the true Man, just as they will rise, the
       women of to-day, to the touch of the true manhood of your
       sons, if you will train them to be to us such men as Jesus
       Christ was. See how He made women His friends, and deigned
       to accept their ministry to His human needs. Many severe
       rebukes are recorded from His lips to men, but not one to a
       woman. It was a woman, ay, even a degraded woman, who by her
       kisses and her tears smote the Rock of Ages and the water of
       life flowed forth for the world, who won for the world the
       words: "He who hath been forgiven much loveth much," and the
       burden of guilt is changed into the burden of Love. It was
       to a woman He first gave the revelation of life, that He
       first revealed Himself as the Water of Life, and first
       uttered the words, "I am the Resurrection and the Life." It
       was women who remained faithful when all forsook Him and
       fled. It was a woman who was the last to whom He spoke on
       the cross, to a woman that the first words were spoken of
       His risen life. It was a woman He made His first messenger
       of the risen life to the world. Nothing in the life of the
       true Man on earth stands out in more marked features than,
       if I may venture to use the words, His faith in women, as if
       to stamp it forever as an attribute of all true manhood,
       that without which a man cannot be a man.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_114"
       id="Page_114"></a>Now, side by side with this attitude of
       the true Man, this perfect loyalty to all womanhood as such,
       ay, even degraded womanhood, place the present debased
       attitude of men, even of some Christian men, which we are
       looking to you mothers of boys to change <i>in toto</i>. Is
       not a powerful writer in the <i>Westminster Review</i> right
       when he says, "There is not found a chivalrous respect for
       womanhood as such. That a woman has fallen is not the
       trumpet call to every noble and wise-hearted man to raise
       her up again as speedily as may be; rather it is the signal
       to deepen her degradation and to doom her to moral death."
       Is it not a received code even among Americans as well as
       Englishmen that if a woman knows how to respect and protect
       herself men are to respect her&mdash;it is only a scoundrel
       that will dare to say an insulting word to her? But if she
       is a bit fast and giddy, if she has little or no respect for
       herself, if her foolish feet have slipped ever so little,
       then she is fair game. "She gave him encouragement; what
       else could she expect? It was her own fault." To expect that
       any man with an ounce of true manhood in him would at once
       say, "That young girl does not in the least realize the
       danger she is in, and I must get between her and the edge of
       the precipice, and see that she comes to no
       harm."&mdash;this would be to expect the wildly impossible.
       Have we not made up our mind that the beast and not the
       Christ is our master here; and does not every beast spring
       at once on a fallen <a name="Page_115"
       id="Page_115"></a>prey? It is human nature, and you will
       never get men to think and act any differently. As to faith
       in man as such, not only in the church-going man, but in the
       rough-spoken fisherman, the contemned publican, the infidel
       Samaritan, faith in his power of recognizing and rising to
       the truth, the higher standard placed before him,
       <i>that</i> I sometimes think lies buried in that Eastern
       garden&mdash;in the Sepulchre "wherein never man yet
       lay."<a name="FNanchor_22_22"
       id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"
       class="fnanchor">[22]</a> And yet it is the man as revealed
       in Jesus Christ, not the man as fashioned by the world, with
       its low traditions and low public opinion, that is true to
       human nature. In moments of excitement or danger he reverts
       to this true nature, which has been so warped and overlaid
       by the world. In the great mass meetings which I held for
       the purpose of pleading with men to come over on my side and
       help me in the work of saving women from the awful doom to
       which men sentence them, I used to bring this home by saying
       to them: "If a fire were to break out in this vast hall, who
       would be the first person that you would try to save? It
       would be me because I am a woman"; and the roar of assent
       that burst forth from all parts of the building showed that
       I had struck home. I used to bring before them&mdash;and the
       sooner you bring it before your boys the better&mdash;the
       conduct of the men on the ill-fated
       <i>Birkenhead</i>&mdash;ah! dear men, voiceless and
       <a name="Page_116"
       id="Page_116"></a>nameless, and lost in that "vast and
       wandering grave" into which they sank, what have they not
       done to raise the tone of England? You will possibly
       remember that the <i>Birkenhead</i>, with a troop of our
       soldiers on board, struck and foundered not far from land.
       The women and children were at once crowded into the boats,
       and it was only when, in a few minutes, the ship began to
       settle that the cry was heard among the men, "To the boats!
       to the boats! every man for himself!" But the officer in
       command stood up and shouted, "What! and swamp the women and
       children? Die rather!" And those men did die. Drawn up in
       military array, without moving a muscle, those men sank into
       the bitter waters of death, that the women and children
       might live.<a name="FNanchor_23_23"
       id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"
       class="fnanchor">[23]</a> That I contend is man's true
       nature, to love the woman, and, if needs be, to give himself
       for her.</p>

    <p>It is, therefore, to recognize and strengthen this true
    nature of man, to get it deeper into him, and not to get it out
    of him, as I cannot but feel we have hitherto more or less
    done, to train your boys in this perfect loyalty to all
    womanhood as such; and to send forth <a name="Page_117"
       id="Page_117"></a>men into the world to "die rather" than
       save themselves at the cost of a woman, to "die rather" than
       drive a woman down into those deep waters of degradation and
       death, that we look to the mothers of the future as the sole
       hope of the world. I say again you have got to see that they
       learn in relation to their own sisters what they have to
       practise towards all women, however humble, ay, and however
       degraded, in their future life. As the great English oaks
       are built up of tiny cells, so this true manliness must be
       built up by a mother's watchful use of a thousand small
       daily incidents&mdash;by what Wordsworth rightly calls the
       best part of a good man's life&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"His little daily, unremembered
            acts<br /></span> <span class="i1">Of kindness and of
            love."<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In themselves they seem almost too trivial to
    mention:&mdash;the easy chair instinctively given up on the
    sister's entrance; the door opened for any woman passing out;
    the cap removed in the presence of ladies, even though those
    ladies are his own relatives; the deck-chair taken out by the
    seaside to make the mother comfortable; the favorite
    cricket-match given up if an expedition has been fixed in which
    his services are needed; the window raised and the door shut on
    leaving a railway-carriage in which women are travelling, so as
    not to expose them to draught; and, when men-servants are not
    kept, the sister's bicycle cleaned or the skates
    <a name="Page_118"
       id="Page_118"></a>polished&mdash;all those "little daily,
       unremembered acts" of knightly service which the mere
       presence of a woman ought to inspire in a man.</p>

    <p>I am well aware that here again, as Mr. Philip Hamerton
    points out, the boarding-school presents a difficulty. As he
    says, "The worst of the distant school system is that it
    deprives the home residence that remains of all beneficial
    discipline; for the boys are guests during the holidays, and
    the great business is to amuse them."<a name="FNanchor_24_24"
       id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"
       class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

    <p>But surely this needs only to be mentioned to be remedied.
    You do not make your boys happier during their holidays by
    making them selfish: what is really a novelty to a schoolboy,
    fresh from the association with boys only, is to have sisters
    to look after and a mother to depend upon him for all sorts of
    little services. A joyous exclamation on your part, "Oh, what a
    comfort it is to have a boy in the house to do things for one!"
    will make him swell with manly pride; and should he show the
    least tendency to put upon his sisters and make them fetch and
    carry for him, as they are only too willing to do, you can
    easily put a stop to that by a few caustic remarks that you
    don't want savages in your house; and a pointed use of that
    delightful story in one of the White Cross
    papers,<a name="FNanchor_25_25"
       id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25"
       class="fnanchor">[25]</a> of the Zulu chief to whom the
       Government sent a propitiatory <a name="Page_119"
       id="Page_119"></a>present of wagons and wheelbarrows,
       thinking that it would be sure to please him. But he gazed
       on them with fine scorn, exclaiming: "What's the use of
       those things for carrying our burdens when we have plenty of
       women!" Or you can use that equally good story, told by Sir
       John Lubbock at a sectional meeting of the British
       Association for the Promotion of Science, of a remote tribe
       of savages who had never seen a bullock, and when the white
       man arrived with his bullock wagons, after much perplexed
       discussion, they came to the conclusion that, as they were
       used for heavy loads, they must be the white man's
       wives!</p>

    <p>A little wholesome, if incisive, raillery on your part will
    quickly extinguish any tendency to make willing slaves of his
    sisters. If, however, you prefer to indulge your foolish
    fondness for him, that subtle self-indulgence which makes it
    easier for you to sacrifice yourself and his sisters to him
    rather than discipline him to work out his true nature,
    remember you gratify yourself at his most cruel cost. You
    produce the boy whose youth is marked by a tacit contempt for
    girls and whose manhood will be disfigured by a light
    estimation of the beauty and sanctity of womanhood.</p>

    <p>I know well I shall be told that all this is quite out of
    date; that modern girls are so independent that they stand in
    no need of brothers, but like to place themselves on a level
    with them and share as good comrades in all their
    rough-and-tumble games. Let us be of good <a name="Page_120"
       id="Page_120"></a>cheer. Sex is a very ancient institution,
       the slow evolution of hundreds of centuries, and is in no
       danger of being obliterated by the fashion of a day. Take
       the most advanced "new woman"; yes, concealed under that
       virile shirt-front, unchoked by that manly necktie and
       turned-up collar, lurking beneath that masculine billy-cock;
       nay, hidden somewhere deeper down than the pockets of even
       those male knickerbockers, you will find the involuntary
       pleasurable thrill at a strong man's chivalrous attention,
       the delicious sense of a man's care and protection, which
       centuries and centuries of physical weakness have woven into
       the very tissues of her being, in however loud and strident
       a voice she may deny it. Whatever changes in the position of
       women may take place, the basic fact remains, and will
       always remain, the man is stronger than the woman, and his
       strength is given him to serve the weaker; and you have got
       to get your girls to be your fellow-helpers in developing
       all that is best and most chivalrous in their brothers, and
       not so to run riot in their independence as to substitute a
       boyish camaraderie for the exquisite relations of the true
       man to the true woman.</p>

    <p>There rises up now before me a boy, one of those delightful
    English boys overflowing with pluck and spirits. His mother had
    come to one of my meetings, and, like so many other mothers, I
    am thankful to say, had received a lifelong impression from
    what I said <a name="Page_121"
       id="Page_121"></a>with regard to the training of boys, and
       she resolved, there and then, to act upon my advice with her
       own boys. She told me some two years after, that this boy
       had come in late one afternoon and explained to her that a
       little girl had asked him to direct her to rather an
       out-of-the-way house. "I thought she might ask that question
       of some one who would tell her wrong, or that she might come
       to some harm, so I thought I had better go with her and see
       her safe to the house." "But what of the cricket-match that
       you wanted so to see?" his mother asked. "Oh, I had to give
       that up. There wasn't time for both."</p>

    <p>On another occasion, when a Christmas-tree was being
    prepared in the schoolroom for some choristers, as he and his
    mother left at dusk a chorister tried to force himself past her
    and gain a private view; and when she refused him admittance,
    not recognizing who she was, called her a very disrespectful
    name. Instantly the boy flew at him like a little tiger, "How
    dare you speak to my mother like that!" "I didn't see it was
    your mother," the chorister pleaded, trying to ward off the
    blows. "But you saw it was a woman, and somebody's mother, and
    you dare to speak to her like that!" And such a storm of
    fisticuffs fell on every part of that hulking young chorister's
    person as forced him at last to cry for mercy and promise that
    he would never do so again. That boy's master wrote to his
    mother towards the end of his school-time&mdash;he was
    a<a name="Page_122"
       id="Page_122"></a> Bluecoat boy&mdash;and said that he
       positively dreaded his leaving, as his influence on the side
       of everything good, and pure, and high was quite that of a
       master.</p>

    <p>And now I come to the question of religious teaching, which
    you may be surprised that I have not put first of all. First of
    all, in one sense, I do put it. There can be no greater
    safeguard to purity of life than vital religion. I do not go so
    far as some evangelical mothers who have told me that nothing
    less than the conversion of their boys would be of the least
    avail to keep them morally straight; on the contrary, I have
    known men who have never come under any strong religious
    influence, but have grown up sceptical scientific men, yet who
    have led lives as pure as any woman's. Common manhood, with the
    "Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world";
    common love for mother and sister, which for their sakes maketh
    it impossible to wrong their womanhood, even when fallen into
    the dust; common self-respect, which is so strong in some men,
    and makes them shrink from anything in the nature of mud, is
    often sufficient to accomplish this end. But still, when all is
    said, if in answer to your mother's prayers you can implant in
    your boy a sense of the Divine Presence and the cry of the
    quickened conscience, "How can I do this great sin and
    wickedness against God?" you have doubtless given him the best
    panoply against the fiery darts of temptation. Only I would
    again warn you that there <a name="Page_123"
       id="Page_123"></a>must be no forcing of the religious
       emotions, no effort to gather the fruits of the spirit
       before the root, in the shape of the great cardinal virtues
       everywhere presupposed in Christian ethics, has been
       nourished, and strengthened, and watered into strong,
       healthy growth. We have to bear in mind our Lord's words,
       which it seems to me religious parents sometimes forget,
       that there is an order of growth in spiritual things as in
       natural&mdash;first the blade, then the ear, and then the
       full corn in the ear; and we are not to try to force the
       full corn in the ear before the stalk and the blade have
       grown. For the want of laying to heart these words of the
       great Teacher, I have known much pulpy, emotional religion
       engrafted on young souls&mdash;admirably adapted to exhaust
       the soil, but with the smallest possible bearing upon right
       conduct; a religion perfectly at its ease with much scamping
       of lessons and hard work in general; indulgent of occasional
       cribbing, and of skilful manipulation of awkward truth, of
       betting and small extravagances; and innocent of all sense
       of dishonesty in allowing a struggling parent to pay large
       sums for education while the school-time so purchased, often
       at the cost of home comforts and pleasant outings, is
       squandered in idleness.</p>

    <p>What a boy really needs, and, indeed, all immature
    things&mdash;for I found it equally true of immature
    men&mdash;is a simple, practical religion, based more on the
    facts of life and conscience than on doctrines and
    dogmas.<a name="Page_124"
       id="Page_124"></a> To know God as his Father; to know that
       he has a Redeemer who laid down His life to save him from
       sin and who takes account of his smallest and most broken
       effort to do what is right; to realize that it is only so
       far as he is like Christ and in Christ that he can be really
       a man and work out what is highest in him; to know that he
       has been baptized into a Divine Society, binding him to
       fight against all wrong, both within and in the world
       without; above all, to know that there is a supreme
       spiritual Power within him and about him to enable him to do
       right, and that in the line of duty "I can't" is a lie in
       the lips that repeat, "I believe in the Holy Ghost"; this is
       as much as his young soul can assimilate, not as mere
       religious phrases, but as realities to live by.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"So nigh to glory is our

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But see that beneath all this he has the special Christian
    teaching with regard to the sanctity of the body thoroughly
    instilled into him. If the Incarnation means anything, it means
    not the salvation and sanctification of a ghost, but the
    salvation and consecration of the whole man, of his body as
    well as his soul. True, the animal body to a spiritual being
    must always be a "body of humiliation," but nothing can be more
    unfortunate and misleading than the epithet in
    the<a name="Page_125"
       id="Page_125"></a> Authorized Version of "vile" as a
       translation of the Greek word used by St. Paul. On the
       contrary, we are taught that even this mortal body is a
       temple of the Holy Ghost.</p>

    <p>In teaching this there can be no difficulty; you can make
    use of a child's natural reverence for a church. You can say,
    "What would you think if you heard of some loose lads breaking
    into a church, and just for the fun of the thing strewing the
    aisles with cinder dust and all sorts of loose rubbish; tearing
    out the pages of Bibles and hymn-books to light their pipes,
    and getting drunk out of the chalice? You would be honestly
    shocked at such profanity. Nay, even in the dire exigencies of
    war we do not think better of the Germans for having stabled
    their horses in one of the French churches and left their
    broken beer-bottles on the high altar and the refuse of a
    stable strewn up and down the nave. Yet a church is, after all,
    only a poor earthly building, built by human hands. But there
    is one temple which God has built for Himself, the temple of
    man's body; and of that the terrible words are written, and
    ever fulfilled, "If any man defile that temple, him will God
    destroy." God's great gift of speech is not to be defiled by
    dirty talk, by profane language, by lies, or evil speaking. The
    organs which are given us for its sustenance are not to be
    denied by gluttony and piggishness, either in food or drink.
    The boy is not to use any part of his body in defiling ways
    which he would <a name="Page_126"
       id="Page_126"></a>be ashamed for his own mother to know of.
       To do so is not only to defile, but&mdash;with the double
       meaning of the Greek word, which we cannot render into
       English&mdash;to destroy; to weaken his brain-power, which
       he wants for his work in life, to weaken his nervous system,
       lessening his strength thereby and rendering him less able
       to excel in athletics, and often, if carried to excess, in
       after-life bringing results which are the very embodiment of
       the terrible words, "Him will God destroy." The full force
       and bearing of this teaching he may not apprehend. I have
       already said that with a young boy the lower appeal never to
       do anything that is low and dirty and blackguardly will have
       far more practical weight, and will also avoid laying undue
       stress on the religious emotions. But I am quite sure that
       the Christian teaching of the sanctity of the body must be
       laid deep and strong with all the force of early impression
       in a boy's inmost being, in order that it may lie ready for
       future use when Nature has developed those instincts of
       manhood which will teach him its full significance.</p>

    <p>If you are an Episcopalian, you will of course find the time
    of your boy's confirmation simply invaluable as one of those
    turning-points which will enable you to speak, or possibly
    write, more unreservedly than is possible on more ordinary
    occasions. I would earnestly ask you to give him a little White
    Cross confirmation paper called <i>Purity the Guard of
    Manhood</i>, <a name="Page_127"
       id="Page_127"></a>a paper which an Eton master pronounced
       the best thing he had met with of the kind, and which has
       been widely used. Do not rest content with merely giving the
       paper in a perfunctory way, but follow it up with a few
       living, earnest words of your own.</p>

    <p>Of course I should do a wrong to your womanly instincts if I
    were to think it necessary to say that the inculcation of
    purity must be always in a mother's heart, but only on her lips
    on some marked occasions, such as the first going to school,
    the last day of the holidays, or when your boy himself gives
    the occasion by some question he may ask you, but above all
    when he reaches a critical age, when a few words from your own
    lips will be worth all the printed pages in the world. Only
    ever and always make it an essential element of his idea of
    manliness to be pure, and do not forget constantly to couple
    the words "brave and pure," or "manly and pure," or "pure and
    high character," in his hearing; that he may be endued, not
    with that pale, emasculate thing that passes muster for purity
    nowadays, which always seems to me chiefly conscious of its own
    indecency, full of the old nervous "touch not, taste not,
    handle not" spirit, bandaged up with this restriction and that
    lest it fall to pieces, and when it comes to saving another
    from defilement in body and soul shuffling uneasily into a pair
    of lavender kid-gloves and muttering something about its being
    "such a very delicate subject"&mdash;nay, not
    <a name="Page_128"
       id="Page_128"></a>this, but that militant sun-clad power
       which Milton dreamed of, rushing down like a sword of God to
       smite everything low, and base and impure; a purity as of
       mountain water or living fire, whose very nature it is, not
       only to be pure itself, but to destroy impurity in
       others.</p>

    <h4>V</h4>

    <p>And now let me throw together two or three practical
    suggestions, which will probably be superfluous to the most
    experienced mothers, but may be useful to younger and more
    inexperienced parents.</p>

    <p>In the first place, I think there are few of the heads of
    the medical profession who would not agree with me that our
    English dietary is too stimulating and too abundant. Sir Andrew
    Clark certainly held that a large proportion of our diseases
    spring from over-eating and over-drinking. I don't suppose that
    for a boy it so much matters, as he is eating for "edification"
    as well as for sustenance, for the building up of his walls as
    well as for the nutrition of his existing frame. But "the boy
    is father to the man," and I would ask you not to accustom your
    boys to a rich dietary, as the habit once formed will be
    prolonged into early manhood, and undoubtedly such stimulating
    diet does greatly increase the temptations with which young men
    have to contend. It is perfectly unnecessary for the developing
    of strength and stature, as is shown by the splendid Scotchmen
    who yearly carry off some of our highest <a name="Page_129"
       id="Page_129"></a>university distinctions and
       prizes&mdash;many of them farmer lads who have scarcely
       tasted meat in their boyhood, but have been brought up on
       the simple farinaceous food of the country. There was much
       force and meaning in the quaint congratulatory telegram sent
       by a friend to a Cambridge Senior Wrangler hailing from
       Scotland, "Three cheers for the parritge!" And that curious
       and most impressive fact which Mr. Bayard, the late American
       Ambassador, hunted up for our edification from various
       dictionaries of biography&mdash;the fact, namely, that a
       large proportion of our most eminent men spring from the
       homes of the poorer clergy, where certainly sumptuous fare
       and much meat do not obtain, is a proof that abstemious
       living, while forming a valuable discipline for the soul,
       does not injure but promotes the health of the body and the
       strength of the brain. Our having given up the religious
       uses of fasting I often think is a loss to young men; and it
       might, therefore, be as well if we were to imitate our
       "Corybantic" brethren, the Salvationists, and institute a
       week of self-denial, leaving the children to work out an
       economical dietary, with due care on our part that it should
       be fairly nutritious, and allowing them to give what they
       have saved from the ordinary household expenses to any cause
       in which they may be interested. It would give them a
       wholesome lesson in self-denial and cheap living; both
       lessons much needed in these luxurious days. But
       <a name="Page_130"
       id="Page_130"></a>whether this suggestion finds favor or
       not, we have always to bear in mind that "plain living" is
       the necessary companion of "high thinking"&mdash;the lowly
       earth-born twin who waits upon her heavenly sister.</p>

    <p>On the vexed question of the use of alcohol there was but
    one point on which there was a consensus of opinion in the
    discussion by our leading medical men, which appeared some
    years ago in the pages of the <i>Contemporary Review</i>. The
    point upon which they were all agreed was that alcohol is
    injurious to children, and if the boy has been accustomed from
    his early youth to do without it, and, as he grows up, remains
    a total abstainer, there is no question that his abstinence
    will prove a great safeguard; though I cannot go as far as some
    of my abstaining friends, who seem to regard the use of alcohol
    as the root of what must, in the nature of things, be one of
    the strongest primal passions of human nature, and therefore
    liable to abuse, whether men are total abstainers or not.
    Anyhow, though a lad can be trained to strict moderation,
    abstinence in both alcohol and tobacco must after a time come
    of the lad's own free will; the last thing that answers is to
    multiply and enforce restrictions; the rebound is inevitable
    and often fatal. But I do say that where there is a great
    pinching in the home in order to afford the educational
    advantages of school and university, it does show some radical
    defect in the training of our <a name="Page_131"
       id="Page_131"></a>boys that they should indulge in such
       expensive habits, especially the expensive and wholly
       unnecessary habit of smoking, when the dear mother and young
       sisters are doing without many a little home comfort in
       order to meet the expense of the young rascal's education.
       One rich old grandmother whom I met abroad promised each of
       her grandsons fifty pounds if they would give up smoking;
       and it was marvellous how that stern necessity of doing as
       other young men do disappeared like their own tobacco smoke
       before the promise of that fifty pounds for their own
       pockets! They were all able to claim it one after the other.
       If boys were not trained by their mothers to be
       systematically selfish, might not the home-claims in the
       heart be as strong as those fifty pounds in the pocket?</p>

    <p>Secondly, with regard to betting and gambling, which may be
    classed with drinking, as the fruitful parent of bad company,
    and a <i>descensus ad infernum</i>:&mdash;do you not think a
    boy may be best guarded against a habit of betting, which is so
    likely to lead on to gambling, by taking the same line as a boy
    of my acquaintance took with his mother when she was warning
    him against it: "Well, mother, you see, it always does seem so
    mean to me to get a fellow's money from him without giving him
    anything in return; it always does seem so like prigging, and
    some of our fellows are awfully hard up, and can't afford to
    lose a penny." Mr. Gladstone was evidently of the same opinion
    when <a name="Page_132"
       id="Page_132"></a>he once said to his private secretary, Sir
       Edward Hamilton, that he "regarded gambling as nothing short
       of damnable. What can be the fun of winning other people's
       money?" This strikes me as a way of putting it which would
       appeal most forcibly to a boy; and if, in addition, we were
       to point out to him that, like all shady things, it has a
       tendency to grow and sharpen the man into a sharper and
       develop the blood-sucking apparatus of a leech, besides
       bringing wretchedness and misery on others, he might be led
       to resist the first beginnings of a betting habit which may
       lead on to gambling in after years.</p>

    <p>And here I would say that the absolute absence of any
    training given to a boy in the right use and value of money,
    which has obtained till lately in our English schools, is
    surely suicidal and must lend itself to every form of abuse. I
    do not know whether it is the same with you, but many of our
    boys know money only in the form of pocket-money, when it
    becomes to him a metal token mostly signifying so much "tuck";
    becoming, as he grows older, more and more deleterious "tuck"
    in the shape of billiards, betting, etc., and ending in a
    general going "on tick," which is worse still. But in this
    matter we are improving. I think most sensible parents nowadays
    place a small sum at their bank to the boy's account, with a
    check-book, making him responsible at first for small articles
    of clothing, neckties, shirt-collars, etc, and as soon as he
    <a name="Page_133"
       id="Page_133"></a>shows himself trustworthy, for all his
       expenses except school bills. The boy is expected to keep
       accounts, get nothing without first asking the price, and to
       bring his receipted bills at the end of the term to his
       father, and see that they tally with his foils; and, above
       all, always to pay in ready money&mdash;unpaid bills being
       contemplated in the bald light of shop-lifting. To this I
       would add, if possible, the habit of giving the Jewish
       tenth, so as to make giving a steady principle, and not a
       hap-hazard impulse.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, it is a vital point to give your boys interesting
    pursuits. There is great force in the rough old saying, "Never
    give the devil an empty chair to sit down upon, and you won't
    be much troubled with his company." Vice is constantly only
    idleness which has turned bad,&mdash;idleness being
    emphatically a thing that will not keep, but turns rotten. It
    is not the great industrial centres of our population that are
    chiefly ravaged by vice; it is the fashionable watering-places,
    the fashionable quarters of large towns, where idle men
    congregate, in which it is a "pestilence that walketh in
    darkness," and slays its thousands of young girls. "Empty by
    filling," has always been a favorite motto of mine. How many a
    young man has been driven to betting, drinking, and the
    race-course from the want of something of interest to fill his
    unoccupied hours, because more wholesome tastes have never been
    developed in him! Of course, tastes must be to a certain
    <a name="Page_134"
       id="Page_134"></a>degree inborn, but I am quite sure that
       many a taste perishes, like a frost-bitten bud, full of the
       promise of blossom and fruit, because it has never been
       given the opportunity to develop.</p>

    <p>Take a boy's innate love of collecting. Could you not
    develop it by the offer of a little prize for the best
    collection of dried flowers, of butterflies or insects, of
    birds' eggs, even, in some cases, of geological specimens, but,
    in any case, with the scientific and common names attached; so
    forming a healthy taste for natural history, which may be a
    source of perpetual interest and profit in after-life? Do not
    let your dislike of destroying life interfere; reverence for
    life can be as well, nay, better taught by insisting that only
    the necessary specimens should be given of each species, only
    one or two eggs taken from the nest, and the nest itself
    disturbed as little as possible. Chemistry and electricity also
    appeal to a boy's love of experimentizing and of making
    electrical contrivances, easily constructed of the commonest
    materials. As to hand-work, the lack of which in ill-health has
    made so many a man a torment both to himself and others, there
    ought to be no difficulty with regard to that. Carpentering,
    wood-carving, repoussé-work in metal, bent-iron work, mosaic
    work, any of these, except possibly the last, may be set on
    foot with very little expense, besides drawing, modelling, etc.
    Where there are sufficient means it would be a good thing if
    boys were taught, as far as may be, how things
    <a name="Page_135"
       id="Page_135"></a>are made and the amount of toil that goes
       into the simplest article. I remember giving a small
       printing-press to a boy of ours&mdash;an excellent gift, by
       the by, for a lad, and it can be had for five or six
       shillings&mdash;and his coming to me soon after with a
       match-box in his hand, exclaiming with wonderment, "Why,
       auntie, there are six different kinds of type on this
       match-box!" If they could learn how to build, how rafters
       and joists are put in, and construct as much as a miniature
       summer-house in the garden, how useful this being able to
       turn their hands to anything might prove to them in their
       after-life. And with what added respect they would look upon
       all labor if they had never looked upon it as the part of a
       "gentleman" to stand aloof from it.</p>

    <p>Lastly, but not least, I would plead most earnestly for the
    frequent home-letter, should your boy be sent to a
    boarding-school. If you would have him resist the temptations
    of school life, keep the home as close to his heart and as
    present to his mind as you can. Make it your first and
    paramount duty to write every day if you can, if not every
    other day, at least twice a week.</p>

    <p>Do not misunderstand me here. God knows I do not go in for
    the devoted mother who thinks of nothing but her boys and to
    whom the whole world besides is nothing but an empty flourish
    of the pen about their names. Such mothers are like Chinese
    teacups, with <a name="Page_136"
       id="Page_136"></a>no perspective and everything out of
       proportion; where the Mandarin is as big as the Pagoda, and
       suffers from a pathetic inability to get in at his own door.
       You must see things in moral perspective in order to train
       character on large and noble lines. And it is from the rough
       quarry of the outside world, with its suffering and sin,
       that you must fetch the most precious stones for the
       building up of true manhood or womanhood. The sooner
       children are taught that their small concerns must be
       subordinated at times to the needs of the sick, the poor,
       and the suffering, the better for them. For a mother,
       therefore, to undertake <i>some</i> outside work may and
       will prove the best element in their education, enabling
       them in their turn to live in relation with the world in
       which God has placed them and do their part in the service
       of humanity.</p>

    <p>All that I mean is, do not so crowd your life with outside
    work or social engagements as to have no time to spare for this
    daily or at least bi-weekly letter to the boys at school. Bear
    in mind that the most important work you can do for the world
    is the formation of noble character, building it up stone by
    stone as you alone can do. Do not be too busy to make yourself
    your boy's friend and throw yourself heartily into all that
    interests him. I have known philanthropic mothers to whom
    cricket was nothing but an unmeaning scurrying backwards and
    forwards, and who scarcely knew the stern of a boat from its
    bows!</p>

    <p><a name="Page_137"
       id="Page_137"></a>And what a liberal education a mother's
       home-letters to her boys at school might be made! The
       stirring incident in the newspapers, the fine passage in the
       book, a verse or two of a noble poem, as well as all the
       loving thought and prayer that is for ever flying like
       homing birds to the dear absent lads, and the inculcation of
       all things lovely and pure and manly, brightened by home
       jokes and the health of the last cherished pet&mdash;all
       these things might go to make up the home letters. Above
       all, what an opportunity it would give for pleading the
       cause of the little chaps who, by some strange insanity
       working in the brain of the British parent, are sent into
       the rough world of a large school when they are fitter for
       the nursery, and whom you might appeal to your boys to look
       after and protect, so far as they are able; and not only
       these, but to side with every boy who is being bullied for
       acting up to his conscience or because he has not the pluck
       to stand up for himself.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, I would earnestly ask you to believe in your
    own power when united to the knowledge which is necessary to
    direct it. "A man is what a woman makes him," says the old saw.
    Look back upon the men you have known who have been touched to
    finest issues, and you will find, with few exceptions, that
    they are the shaping of a noble woman's hands&mdash;a noble
    mother, a noble wife, a noble sister. Doubt not, but earnestly
    believe that with those wonderful shaping <a name="Page_138"
       id="Page_138"></a>hands of yours you can mould that boy of
       yours into the manhood of Sir Galahad, "whose strength was
       as the strength of ten because his heart was pure"; that you
       can send him forth into the world like King Arthur, of whom
       our own poet, Spenser, says, that the poorest, the most
       unprotected girl could feel that</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"All the while he by his side her
            bore<br /></span> <span class="i0">She was as safe as
            in a sanctuary."<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Nay, may I not go further still and say that by the grace of
    God you can send him forth "made of a woman" in the image of
    the strong and tender Manhood of Jesus Christ, to Whom even the
    poor lost girls out of the street could come and know that here
    was a Man who would not drag them down, but lift them up;
    believing in Whom, clinging to Whom, trusting in Whom, they
    grew no longer lost and degraded, but splendid saints of the
    Christian Church.</p>

            the gradual evolution of the preservative and
            altruistic elements in nature, arising from the
            struggle for existence, to a sermon of Dr. Abbott's
            called <i>The Manifestation of the Son of God</i>, now,
            I fear, out of print. Of course Darwin recognized these
            factors as a necessary complement to the survival of
            the fittest, else had there been no fittest to survive;
            but the exigencies of proving his theory of the origin
            of species necessitated his dwelling on the destructive
            and weeding-out elements of Nature&mdash;"Nature red in
            tooth and claw," rather than the equally pervasive
            Nature of the brooding wing and the flowing breast. Had
            not Professor Drummond unfortunately mixed it up with a
            good deal of extraneous sentiment, his main thesis

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII"
       id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

    <h3>EARLY MANHOOD</h3>

    <p>If, in the words of the great educator I have already
    quoted, the chief moral teaching and moral trend of the
    character must be given in the schoolboy days, yet early
    manhood presents its own fruitful field for the influence of a
    mother on the side of whatsoever things are pure and lovely.
    The methods of exerting this influence must change as your son
    grows from a boy into a man; the inevitable reticence, the
    exquisite reserve of sex, must interfere with the old boyish
    confidences and with your own freedom of speech. Other
    barriers, too, will most likely spring up as your son goes
    forth into the world and mixes freely with other young men of
    his own standing. Whether it be at college, or in the army, or
    in business, he will inevitably be influenced by the views of
    the men he associates with, which he will enlarge into the
    opinion of the world in general, and will probably come home,
    if not to contradict his mother, at least to patronize her and
    go his own way, smiling at her with an air of manly superiority
    and with a lofty consciousness that he knows a thing or two
    which lie beyond a woman's <a name="Page_140"
       id="Page_140"></a>ken. Probably enough he takes up with
       views on religion, or politics, or social questions which
       are emphatically not yours, and which make you feel left
       very far behind, instead of the old familiar "walking
       together" which was so sweet. Worse still, he may evince for
       a time a cynical indifference to all great questions, and
       all your teaching may seem to be lost in a desert flat. The
       days of the latch-key and the independent life have come,
       and you often seem to stand outside the walls which once
       admitted you into their dearest recesses, left with but
       little clue as to what is going on within.</p>

    <p>But have patience. Early teaching and influence, though it
    may pass for a time into abeyance, is the one thing that leaves
    an indelible impress which will in the end make itself felt,
    only waiting for those eternal springs which well up sooner or
    later in every life to burst into upward growth; it may be a
    pure attachment, it may be a great sorrow, it may be a sickness
    almost unto death, it may be some awakening to spiritual
    realities. I often think of that pathetic yet joyful
    resurrection cry, "This is our God, we have waited for
    Him"&mdash;waited for Him, possibly through such long years of
    disappointment and heart hunger&mdash;only to cry at the last,
    "This is our God, we have waited for Him, and He has saved
    us."</p>

    <p>But it is not all waiting. If with early manhood the "old
    order" has to give place to new, and old methods
    <a name="Page_141"
       id="Page_141"></a>and instruments have to be laid aside as
       no longer fitted for their task, God puts into the hands of
       the mother new instruments, new methods of appeal, which in
       some ways are more powerful than the old. In early manhood
       she can appeal to the thought of the future wife. I believe
       that this appeal is one of the strongest that you can bring
       to bear upon young men.</p>

    <p>I once had to make it myself under circumstances of
    unparalleled difficulty; and I was struck with the profound
    response that it evoked. It was on the occasion of the
    inaugural White Cross address to the students of the Edinburgh
    University, now one of the first medical schools in the world.
    The date of the address had been fixed, the hall taken, when an
    unforeseen difficulty arose. Eminent man after eminent man was
    asked to give the address, but all with one consent began to
    make excuse. Spirit and flesh quailed before so difficult and
    rowdy an audience on so difficult and perilous a subject. At
    last the professor who was chiefly interested implored me to
    give the address myself, or the whole thing would go by
    default. Under these circumstances I had no choice but to do
    so. But as I sat in the committee room while the order of the
    meeting was being arranged, and heard my audience shouting,
    singing, crowing like cocks, whistling like parrots,
    caterwauling like cats, and keeping up a continuous uproar, I
    thought to myself, "I have got to go into that, and control it
    somehow so as to be heard"; I confess I <a name="Page_142"
       id="Page_142"></a>did feel wrecked upon God. Professor
       Maclagan, who took the chair, agreed that a prayer was
       impossible, a hymn was equally out of the question. The only
       thing was to push me at once to the front; and almost
       immediately after a few very brief words from the
       distinguished chairman I found myself face to face with an
       audience that evidently meant mischief. By some instinct I
       told them at once about James Hinton, whom, of course, they
       knew by name as the first aurist of his day; how, with all
       that this life could give him, he had died of a broken
       heart, a heart broken over the lost and degraded womanhood
       of England, the hosts of young girls slain in body and soul
       whom he met with at night in our terrible streets. This
       seemed to strike and sober them, that a man should actually
       die over a thing which to all of them was so familiar and to
       many had been only the subject of a coarse jest.
       Fortunately, there is a stage of nervous terror which rounds
       again on desperate courage, and having once got hold of my
       audience, I determined to use the occasion to the uttermost
       and venture on the most perilous ground. In the course of my
       address I asked them to take notice of a great silent change
       that was taking place all round them in the position of
       women, the full significance of which they might not have
       grasped. Everywhere women were leaving the seclusion of
       their homes and were quietly coming forward and taking their
       place by their side in the great work of the world. I
       thanked <a name="Page_143"
       id="Page_143"></a>them for the generous welcome that they
       had accorded them. But had they seized the full meaning, the
       ulterior bearings of this changed attitude in women, and the
       wider knowledge of the world that it brought with it? Not so
       long ago it was an understood thing that women should know
       nothing of the darker side of life; and there was nothing
       dishonorable in a man keeping the woman he loved in
       ignorance of the darker side of his own past, if such there
       were. But in the greater knowledge that has come to women,
       and the anguish some of them feel over the misery and
       degradation of their lost sisters, can this attitude any
       longer be maintained without conscious deception? "What
       would you say," I asked, "if the woman you loved with the
       whole strength of your soul passed herself off as an
       undamaged article upon you, and let you worship her as the
       very embodiment of all that is white and pure, when
       something unspeakably sad and sinful had happened in her
       past life? You know you would be half mad at the wrong done
       to you if after marriage you found it out. And what are you
       going to do, I ask some of you who are so careless as to the
       life you lead, are <i>you</i> going to pass yourself off as
       an undamaged article on the woman who loves and worships
       you, and who gives herself so unreservedly to you that she
       loses her very name and takes yours? Is it fair, is it
       honorable, is it even manly? No, I see by your faces you are
       saying, 'I don't think it is, I should have to
       <a name="Page_144"
       id="Page_144"></a>confess.' Well, that is better than basing
       your life on a dishonorable lie. But, alas! it is no way out
       of the misery. At the very moment when you would give all
       you possess to be worthy of that great love she gives you,
       you have to prove that you are unworthy; and the whole of
       the only last gleam of Eden that is left to this poor life
       of yours, the pure love of a man to a pure woman, is blotted
       out with bitter and jealous tears; the trail of the serpent
       is over it all. I know well that women can love, and love
       passionately, impure men; but every woman will tell you that
       there is <i>a</i> love that a woman can only give to a man
       who has been faithful to her before marriage as well as
       after; and for ever and for ever there will be a shut door
       at the very heart of your Eden of which you have flung away
       the key, a love that might have been yours had you kept
       yourself worthy of it. There is but one way out of the
       difficulty, now that in the changed position of women you
       can no longer honorably keep them in the dark&mdash;to make
       up your mind that you will come to the woman you love in the
       glory of your unfallen manhood, as you expect her to come to
       you in the beauty of her spotless maidenhood."</p>

    <p>I did not know for one moment whether they would not break
    out into cooing like doves; but, on the contrary, they listened
    to me with profound attention, and I could see that none of my
    words went so home to them as those. When I had finished my
    address a <a name="Page_145"
       id="Page_145"></a>member of the committee said to one of the
       professors, "I think if she had asked them to go off and
       storm Edinburgh Castle they would have marched off in a body
       and done it." So great is the power of a woman pleading for
       women.</p>

    <p>If I could use this sacred plea with effect under
    circumstances of&mdash;I think you will allow&mdash;such
    unspeakable difficulty, must it not be possible to you, the
    mother from whom such an appeal would come so naturally, to use
    this same influence, and in the quiet Sunday walk through the
    fields and woods where Nature herself seems to breathe of the
    sanctity of life in every leaf and flower, or in the quiet talk
    over the winter fireside before he leaves home, to plead with
    your son to keep himself faithful to his future wife, so that
    when he meets the woman he can love and make his wife, he may
    have no shameful secrets to confess, or, worse still, to
    conceal from her, no base tendencies to hand down to his unborn
    children after him? Thank God! how many an American and English
    wife and mother can speak here from personal experience of the
    perfect love and perfect trust which have been bred of a pure
    life before marriage, and a knowledge that the sacraments of
    love and life had never been desecrated or defiled, so that no
    shadow of distrust or suspicion can ever darken the path of her
    married happiness. How powerful the pleading of such a mother
    may become with her son, to give his future wife the same
    <a name="Page_146"
       id="Page_146"></a>perfect trust and unclouded happiness in
       her husband's love!</p>

    <p>I remember in a series of allegorical pictures by an old
    master in the Baptistery at Florence, how, with the divine
    instinct of poets and artists, in the beautiful symbolic figure
    of Hope, the painter has placed a lily in her hands. Cannot we
    teach our sons that if they are to realize their dearest hope
    in life, that divine hope must ever bear a lily in her hand as
    the only wand that can open to them the paradise of the ideal,
    the divine vision which is "the master light of all our
    seeing," the deepest and most sacred joys of our life?</p>

    <p>Again, could we not give our boys a little more teaching
    about the true nature and sacredness of fatherhood? It always
    strikes me that the true ethics of fatherhood are not yet born.
    Were the true nature, the sacredness, and the immense
    responsibilities of fatherhood really and duly recognized, men
    could not look with the appalling lightness with which they do
    <a name="Page_147"
       id="Page_147"></a>on providing some substitute for marriage,
       when they have not the means to marry in early life, and are
       under the very prevalent illusion that continent men who
       marry late run the risk of a childless marriage&mdash;a
       notion which so great an authority as Acton pronounces to be
       absolutely false physiologically, and without foundation in
       fact. To bring a child into the world to whom he can perform
       no one of the duties of a father, and to whom he
       deliberately gives a mother with a tarnished name&mdash;a
       mother who, from the initial wrong done to her and the
       stigma which deprives her of the society of women, will only
       too probably not stay her feet at the first wrong step, but
       be drawn down that dread winding stair which ends in the
       despair of a lost soul&mdash;this, I urge, would be utterly
       abhorrent to every even fairly right-thinking man, instead
       of the very common thing it is. Did we see it truly, it
       would be a not venial sin, but an unpardonable crime.</p>

    <p>Now, surely mothers can supply some teaching here which must
    be wanting for public opinion to be what it is. A quiet talk
    about the high nature, the duties and responsibilities of
    fatherhood cannot present any great difficulties.</p>

    <p>I remember many years ago hearing Canon Knox Little preach a
    sermon in York Cathedral to a large mixed congregation, in
    which he touched on this subject. At this distance of time I
    can only give the freest rendering of his words, the more so as
    I have so <a name="Page_148"
       id="Page_148"></a>often used them in my own meetings that I
       may have unconsciously moulded them after my own fashion.
       "Look," he said, "at that dying father&mdash;dying in the
       faith, having fought the good fight, and all heaven now
       opening before his dying gaze. Yet he withdraws his thoughts
       from that great hereafter to centre them upon the little lad
       who stands at his bedside. His hands wander over the golden
       head with</p>

    <p class="center">"'The vast sad tenderness of dying men.'</p>

    <p>He triumphs over pain and weakness that he may plot and plan
    every detail of the young life which he can no longer live to
    guide and direct. And when at length he seems to have passed
    into the last darkness, and they hold up the child to see if he
    will yet recognize him, suddenly the spirit seems to sweep back
    again over the dark river which it has almost crossed, and an
    ineffable light illumines the dying face as his lips meet the
    lips of his little son in one last supreme kiss&mdash;the
    father's love for one moment vanquishing death itself. And
    what, I ask," said the preacher, in tones that thrilled that
    vast audience, "must be the sin of desecrating and defiling
    such a function as this, this function of fatherhood in which
    man seems to touch upon God Himself and become the
    representative of the Father in heaven&mdash;what must be the
    guilt of turning it into a subject of filthy jests and a source
    of unclean actions?"</p>

    <p>The friend with whom I was staying had brought
    <a name="Page_149"
       id="Page_149"></a>with her her Bible class of Industrial
       School lads, and when the next day she asked what had struck
       them most in the sermon, they answered promptly, "What he
       said about fathers," Let us go and teach likewise.</p>

    <p>But perhaps the most precious sphere of influence is that
    which comes to a mother last and latest of all&mdash;too late,
    unless the moral training of all preceding years has been made
    one long disciplinary preparation in self-mastery and pureness
    of living, for the higher and more difficult self-control, the
    far sterner discipline, of true marriage pure and undefiled.
    But if through her training and influence "the white flower of
    a blameless life" has been worn</p>

    <p>then this is the time when her long patient sowing comes to
    its golden fruitage. It is to his mother that a young man turns
    as his confidant in his engagement; it is to her that he
    necessarily turns for counsel and advice with regard to his
    young wife in the early years of his marriage. A young man in
    love is a man who can receive divine truth even of the hardest,
    for love is of God, and its very nature is self-giving.</p>

    <p>A pure affection is an almost awful revelation in itself to
    a young man of the true nature of sensual
    sin.<a name="Page_150"
       id="Page_150"></a> He would gladly die for the woman he
       loves. And we look, therefore, to you mothers to bring into
       the world that Christian ideal of marriage which at present
       is practically shut up between the covers of our Bibles,
       that the man is to love the woman, the husband the
       wife,<a name="FNanchor_27_27"
       id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27"
       class="fnanchor">[27]</a> "as Christ loved the Church and
       gave Himself for it"; not our ideal of the self-sacrificing
       woman&mdash;our patient Griseldas and Enids and all the rest
       of it&mdash;but the self-sacrificing man, who is but poorly
       represented in our literature at all,&mdash;the man who
       loves the woman and gives himself for her, holding all the
       strongest forces and passions of his nature for her good, to
       crown her with perfect wifehood and perfect motherhood.</p>

    <p>This Christian ideal was doubtless intended to fulfil those
    restrictions of the Levitical Law which were to safeguard the
    health of the wife and secure the best conditions for the
    unborn child; laws and regulations to the observance of which
    the Jew doubtless owes his splendid physique and his still more
    splendid mental endowments, which, though he is the fewest of
    all peoples, bring him everywhere to the forefront,&mdash;in
    finance, in literature, in music, in general
    capacity,&mdash;and to which, I should be inclined to add, he
    owes his comparatively slow rate of increase, else it is
    difficult to understand the small numerical strength of this
    extraordinary race; but I know that this is a disputed
    <a name="Page_151"
       id="Page_151"></a>point. No jot or tittle of these laws and
       regulations can pass away until they are fulfilled in some
       larger truth; for ignore them or not, they are founded on
       physiological laws; and it is on mothers' recognizing this
       larger truth in the advice they give, and on their bringing
       in the Christian ideal, that the future of marriage mainly
       depends, and its being made more consonant with the higher
       and more independent position of women than it at present
       is.</p>

    <p>Whilst the sight is so familiar of wives with health broken
    down and life made a burden, possibly even premature death
    incurred, by their being given no rest from the sacred duties
    of motherhood, to say nothing of the health of the hapless
    child born under such circumstances, can we wonder that the
    modern woman often shows a marked distaste to marriage and
    looks upon it as something low and sensual? Or can we wonder
    that married men, with so sensual an ideal of so holy a state,
    should, alas! so largely minister to the existence of an
    outcast class of women?</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the remedy resorted to is often worse
    than the disease. I confess I have stood aghast at the advice
    given by Christian mothers, often backed up by a doctor whom
    they affirm to be a Christian man, in order to save the health
    of the wife or limit the increase of the family. The heads of
    the profession, in England, I believe, are sound on this point,
    a conference having been held some years ago by our
    <a name="Page_152"
       id="Page_152"></a>leading medical men to denounce all such
       "fruits of philosophy" as physically injurious and morally
       lowering.</p>

    <p>But if we want to know what their practical results are, the
    moral gangrene they are to the national life when once they
    have firmly taken hold of a nation, we have only to look across
    the channel at France&mdash;France with her immense wealth, but
    rapidly declining population, which in less than a century will
    reduce her from a first-rate to a second-or third-rate power,
    so that her statesmen have actually debated the expediency of
    offering a premium on illegitimacy in the shape of free nurture
    to all illegitimate children,&mdash;illegitimate citizens being
    better in their estimation than no citizens at all.</p>

    <p>Would we have the Anglo-Saxon race enter on this downward
    grade? If not, then let us women silently band together to
    preserve the sanctity of the family, of the home, and sternly
    to bar out the entrance of all that defileth&mdash;all that
    sensualizes her men and enfeebles their self-mastery, all that
    renders the heart of her women too craven to encounter the
    burdens of being the mothers of a mighty race, flowing out into
    all the lands to civilize and Christianize, and "bear the white
    man's burthen."</p>

    <p>One word more, a sad and painful one, but one which comes
    from my inmost heart. Do not pass by the sadder aspects of this
    great moral question and <a name="Page_153"
       id="Page_153"></a>refuse "to open thy mouth for the dumb,"
       for those "who are appointed unto destruction."</p>

    <p>You cannot keep your son in ignorance of the facts; the
    state of our miserable streets, every time he walks out in the
    evening in any of our large towns, absolutely forbids that
    possibility. But you can place him in the right attitude to
    meet those facts whether in the streets or among his own
    companions. It is by fighting the evils without that we can
    best fight the evils within. It is in dragging them down that
    we are lifted up. A noble passion for the wronged, the weak,
    the sinful, and the lost is the best means for casting out the
    ignoble passions which would destroy another in order to have a
    good time one's self. At present the stock phrase of a virtuous
    young man is, "I know how to take care of myself." You have to
    put into his lips and heart a stronger and a nobler utterance
    than that: "I know how to take care of the weakest woman that
    comes in my path." Surely it is requiring no impossible moral
    attitude in our sons, rather mere common manliness, to expect
    that when spoken to by some poor wanderer, he should make
    answer in his heart if not with his lips, "My girl, I have got
    a sister, and it would break my heart to see her in your place,
    and I would rather die than have any part in your degradation."
    One mother I know, who had been much engaged in rescue work,
    and into whose heart the misery and degradation of our outcast
    girls had entered like iron, taught her young
    <a name="Page_154"
       id="Page_154"></a>son always to take off his hat before
       passsing on, whenever he was accosted. He told a friend of
       mine that he had scarcely ever known it to fail. Either the
       poor girl would say, "Sir, I am very sorry I spoke to you";
       or more frequently still that little mark of human respect
       would prove too much, and she would silently turn away and
       burst into tears. If our sons cannot bare their heads before
       that bowed and ignoble object on whom the sins of us all
       seem to have met&mdash;the wild passions of men, as well as
       the self-righteousness of the Church&mdash;then our young
       men are not what I take them to be,&mdash;nay, thank God!
       what I know them to be, sound of head and sound of heart.
       They get hold of facts by the wrong end; they cut into the
       middle of a chain, and look upon the woman as the aggressor,
       and contemplate her as an unclean bird of prey. They do not
       in the least realize the slight and morally trivial things
       that cast too many of our working-class girls down into the
       pit of hell that skirts their daily path&mdash;often as mere
       children who know not what they do, often from hunger and
       desperation, often tricked and drugged, and always heavily
       bribed. But let them know the facts, let them read a little
       paper such as the <i>Black Anchor</i>, the <i>Ride of
       Death</i>, or <i>My Little
       Sister</i>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28"
       id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28"
       class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and they will feel the whole thing
       to be, in their own rough but expressive words, "a beastly
       shame," and <a name="Page_155"
       id="Page_155"></a>fight it both in themselves and in others,
       for our sakes as well as their own. For the misery as things
       are is this:&mdash;that men divide us into two
       classes&mdash;we pure women for whom nothing is too good;
       and those others, whom they never associate with us, for
       whom nothing is too bad. And what we have to teach them is
       this&mdash;that our womanhood is ONE that a sin against them
       is a sin against us, and so to link the thought of us to
       them that for the sake of their own mothers, for the sake of
       their own sisters, above all, for the sake of the future
       wife, they cannot wrong or degrade a woman or keep up a
       degraded class of women.</p>

    <p>I am aware that, besides the suggestions I have made, young
    men require a plain, emphatic warning as to the physical
    dangers of licentiousness and of the possibility of contracting
    a taint which medical science is now pronouncing to be
    ineradicable and which they will transmit in some form or other
    to their children after them. We want a strong cord made up of
    every strand we can lay hold of, and one of these strands is
    doubtless self-preservation, though in impulsive youth I do not
    think it the strongest. But to give these warnings is
    manifestly the father's duty, and not the mother's; and I hope
    and believe that the number of fathers who are beginning to
    recognize their duty in this matter, as moral teachers of their
    boys, is steadily increasing. In the case of widowed mothers,
    or where the father absolutely refuses to say anything, perhaps
    the <a name="Page_156"
       id="Page_156"></a>paper I have already mentioned, <i>Medical
       Testimony</i>,<a name="FNanchor_29_29"
       id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29"
       class="fnanchor">[29]</a> would be the best substitute for
       the father's living voice.</p>

    <p>And now let me conclude this chapter, as I concluded the
    last, with a few scattered practical suggestions which may
    prove of use. My experience has been that the vast majority of
    our young men go wrong not from any vicious tendencies, but
    from want of thought, want of knowledge, and a consequent
    yielding to the low moral tone of so-called men of the world,
    and the fear of being chaffed as "an innocent." See that your
    boy is guarded from this want of thought and want of knowledge.
    When your son is a Sixth Form boy&mdash;it is impossible to
    give the age more definitely, as it must depend upon the
    character of the boy&mdash;place in his hands the White Cross
    paper, <i>True Manliness</i> which will give him the facts
    about his own manhood. This paper was carefully revised by the
    late Bishop of Durham, Dr. Lightfoot, whose specialty was young
    men; and upwards of a million copies have been sold, which in
    itself guarantees it as a safe paper. Nor need you as a mother
    of sons fear to read over any of the White Cross papers, since
    they concern themselves, as their name denotes, with purity and
    a high ideal of life&mdash;not with the sewer, but with the
    fountain of sweet waters.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_157"
       id="Page_157"></a>Should your boys be so inclined, you might
       suggest their joining that band of modern knights, the White
       Cross Society.<a name="FNanchor_30_30"
       id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30"
       class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It is a great thing to give a
       young man a high ideal to act up to, and the White Cross
       would certainly give him this, as well as save him, with its
       definite obligations, from evil that is incurred from sheer
       thoughtlessness and animal spirits, enforcing a respectful
       and chivalrous treatment of women, even when by their fast
       ways those women show that they have no respect for
       themselves. But more especially is this the case with regard
       to the second obligation, to discountenance coarse jests and
       allusions and the by no means nice sort of talk that often
       goes on in smoking-rooms, and by which, I am convinced, more
       than by any other agency the mind and conscience of young
       men is gradually deadened and defiled, but in which they are
       apt to join from sheer thoughtlessness and sense of fun.
       Their White Cross obligation might screw up their moral
       courage to utter some such <a name="Page_158"
       id="Page_158"></a>pointed rebuke as Dr. Jowett's to a lot of
       young men in a smoking-room, "I don't want to make myself
       out better than you are, but is there not more dirt than wit
       in that story?" or that other still more public rebuke which
       he administered at his own dinner-table when, the gentlemen
       having been left to their wine, a well-known diplomat began
       telling some very unsavory stories, till the still, small,
       high-pitched voice of the Master made itself heard, saying,
       "Had we not better adjourn this conversation till we join
       the ladies in the drawing-room?" At least they can keep
       silence and a grave face; and silence and a grave face are
       often the best damper to coarse wit. Why, I ask, should men
       when they get together be one whit coarser than women? It is
       simply an evil fashion, and as an evil fashion can and will
       be put down as "bad form."</p>

    <p>I think also that joining the White Cross will make young
    men more active in trying to influence other young men and to
    guard and help their younger brothers, with all the other
    priceless work that they can, if they will, do for our
    womanhood among men, but which, from shyness and reserve and
    the dread of being looked upon as moral prigs, they are apt to
    let go by default.</p>

    <p>But whether you agree with me or not with regard to your
    sons' joining an organization, see that they assume their
    rightful attitude of guardians of the purity of the home. We
    women cannot know anything about <a name="Page_159"
       id="Page_159"></a>the inner secrets of men's lives, or know
       whom to exclude and whom to admit to the society of our
       girls. This ought to be the part of the brothers. God knows
       we do not want to make a pariah class of men on the same
       lines as are meted out to women. The young man who wants to
       do better we are bound to help, and no better work can be
       done in our large cities than to open our homes to young men
       in business or in Government offices, etc. But men who are
       deliberately leading a fast life and who are deeply stained
       with the degradation of our own womanhood, with no wish to
       rise out of their moral slough, these must be to us as moral
       lepers, to be gilded by no wealth, to be cloaked by no
       insignia of noble birth, or we stand betrayed as hypocrites
       and charlatans in our own cause. If our position in society
       is such as obliges us to receive such men, we all know the
       moral uses of ice, and under the guise of the most frigid
       politeness we can make them feel their absolute exclusion
       from the inner circle of our friends and intimates. There
       need be no discussion between you and your son&mdash;just
       the hint: "Oh, mother, I would not ask that fellow if I were
       you," and you will know what is meant.</p>

    <p>Much may also be done by keeping up the general high tone of
    the home. One mother of eight sons, who all turned out men of
    high, pure life, if ever they used in her presence such
    expressions as "a well-groomed woman," or commended their last
    partner at a ball as<a name="Page_160"
       id="Page_160"></a> "a pretty little filly," would instantly
       interrupt them and ask incisively, "Are you talking of a
       horse or a woman? If you are talking of a woman, you will be
       pleased to remember that you are speaking in the presence of
       your mother and your sisters." And if any scandal about a
       woman was mooted, the conversation was at once quietly
       turned into another and more profitable channel.</p>

    <p>A word of homely advice from you to your sons with regard to
    our streets at night: never to loiter, but to trudge on
    quickly, when they would be rarely molested, may be advisable
    and useful.</p>

    <p>As to absolute watchfulness with regard to the young
    maid-servants in your house, this is so obvious a point that it
    scarcely needs mentioning; though at the same time I have known
    the most culpably careless arrangements made when the family
    are away for their summer holidays, young maid-servants being
    left alone in the house while the young men are still going
    backwards and forwards to their business; or the whole family
    going out and no older woman being left in charge of the young
    domestics. What can one expect but that, having sown moral
    carelessness, we shall reap corruption?</p>

    <p>But even with no such culpable neglect of our
    responsibilities, I do wish we would cultivate more human
    relations with our servants, and so get them to work more
    consciously with us in maintaining a high Christian tone in our
    homes. If we would but take a more <a name="Page_161"
       id="Page_161"></a>individual interest in them and their
       belongings, as we should do with those we count our friends;
       getting a good situation for the younger sister who is just
       coming on, possibly giving her a few weeks of good training
       in our own household; giving the delicate child of the
       family change of air and good food, even taking in a baby to
       enable a sick mother to go for a short time into a hospital.
       All these things I have found possible in my own household.
       And surely such thought and care for those they hold dear
       would form a living bond between mistress and servant. If we
       would take the same thought and care for pleasant breaks in
       the monotony of our young servants' lives as we do for our
       own girls, would the servant difficulty press upon us to the
       same degree? Nay, if we could set going a weekly or
       fortnightly working party with our own servants in some
       cause which would interest us both, reading out some
       interesting narrative in connection with it, could we not
       even in this small way establish a bond of common service
       and make us feel that we were all working together for the
       same Master, so that our servants might become our helpers,
       and not, as they sometimes are, our hinderers, in bringing
       up our children in a high and pure moral atmosphere?</p>

    <p>But when all things are said and done, I know that with
    every mother worthy the name there must be moments of deep
    discouragement and sense of failure&mdash;a sense of mistakes
    made with some difficult nature to <a name="Page_162"
       id="Page_162"></a>which her own gives her but little clue; a
       sense of difficulties in vain grappled with, of shortcomings
       in vain striven against. Which of us have not had such
       moments of despondency in the face of a great task? In such
       moments I have often called to mind one of those parables of
       Nature which are everywhere around us, unseen and unheeded,
       like those exquisite fresco angels of the old masters, in
       dim corners of ancient churches, blowing silent trumpets of
       praise and adoration and touching mute viols into mystic
       melodies which are lost to us. So thin has the material veil
       grown under the touch of modern science that everywhere the
       spiritual breaks through. Often in that nameless
       discouragement before unfinished tasks, unfulfilled aims,
       and broken efforts, I have thought of how the creative Word
       has fashioned the opal, made it of the same stuff as desert
       sands, mere silica&mdash;not a crystallized stone like a
       diamond, but rather a stone with a broken heart, traversed
       by hundreds of small fissures which let in the air, the
       breath, as the Spirit is called in the Greek of our New
       Testament; and through these two transparent mediums of such
       different density it is enabled to refract the light and
       reflect every lovely hue of heaven, while at its heart burns
       a mysterious spot of fire. When we feel, therefore, as I
       have often done, nothing but cracks and desert dust, we can
       say, "So God maketh his precious opal." Our very sense of
       brokenness and failure makes room for the Spirit to
       <a name="Page_163"
       id="Page_163"></a>enter in, and through His strength made
       perfect in human weakness we are made able to reflect every
       tender hue of the eternal Loveliness and break up the white
       light of His truth into those rays which are fittest for
       different natures; while that hidden lamp of the sanctuary
       will burn in your heart of hearts for ever a guide to your
       boy's feet in the devious ways of life.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, I should like to record an incident full of
    encouragement to mothers. A young fellow of eighteen or
    nineteen, whom his widowed mother had brought up on the
    principles which I have been advocating, said to her one day,
    "Mother, you know that men don't always think like you about
    poor girls." "Alas!" she replied, "I know that but too well;
    but what makes you say so?" "Well, mother, I was with a lot of
    college fellows yesterday, and they were giving one another the
    best addresses in the West End to go to." "But didn't you say
    anything?" "No, I only kept silence. Had I said anything, they
    would only have called me a confounded prig. There were three
    other fellows who kept silence, and I could see they did not
    approve, but we none of us spoke up." "Oh, my son," exclaimed
    his mother in great distress, "how are we to help you young
    fellows? Do you think if the clergy were more faithful, they
    could help you more than they do?" "I don't think they would
    listen to what a parson says." "Then if doctors were to warn
    you more plainly than they do?" "I don't <a name="Page_164"
       id="Page_164"></a>think it would be of much use; they would
       not heed; and then a fellow generally goes to a doctor too
       late." "Then what can we do, what can we do?" "Well, I think
       there is only one person who can really help, and that's a
       fellow's mother&mdash;she can save him, if she would only
       try."</p>

    <p>Doubt not, but earnestly believe. "In every man's breast is
    to be found a lotus-blossom," says the pretty old Indian
    saying, and, watered by your prayers and your tears, be sure it
    will blossom into "the white flower of a blameless life."</p>

    <h3>THE INFLUENCE OF SISTERS</h3>

    <p>Hitherto I have dealt exclusively with the moral training of
    boys and young men, but I am aware that I have left out one of
    the great shaping influences of a boy's life, which certainly
    comes next to the mother's where it exists&mdash;the influence
    of sisters. The childish hand that he clasps in his is the hand
    that unconsciously moulds him to higher ends or the reverse.
    For if the man is the director, the ruler, and defender, "the
    builder of the house" as he is called in the grand old word
    husband,<a name="FNanchor_31_31"
       id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31"
       class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the woman is the shaping and
       moulding influence of life; and if God has placed her in the
       power of the man, both through the weakness of her frame and
       the strength of her affections, on the other hand He has
       given into her hands the keys of his being, and according as
       he fulfils or abuses his trust towards her, she opens or
       closes the door of higher life to
       him.<a name="FNanchor_32_32"
       id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32"
       class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

    <p><a name="Page_166"
       id="Page_166"></a>I often wonder whether we women
       sufficiently realize this truth for ourselves or our girls.
       Walter Bagehot used to say in his blind, masculine way,
       "It's a horrid scrape to be a woman,"&mdash;a sentiment
       which, I fear, will find some echo in the hearts of a good
       many women themselves. But is it so? If to the man chiefly
       belongs power in all its forms, does not the woman wield as
       her portion that far more potent but wholly silent, and
       often unnoticed thing, influence? Not the storm, or the
       earthquake, or the strong wind, but the still, small voice:
       the benediction of dews and gentle rains, the mute
       beatitudes of still waters flowing through sun-parched lands
       and transforming them into "fruitful fields that the Lord
       hath blest"; the silent but irresistible influence of the
       sunlight, which in the baby palm of a little leaf becomes a
       golden key to unlock the secret treasures of the air and
       build up great oaks out of its invisible elements; the
       still, small voice of the moral sense, so still, so small,
       so powerless to enforce its dictates, but before which all
       the forces of the man do bow and obey, choosing death rather
       than disobedience&mdash;are not all these silent influences
       emblems of the supreme, shaping, moulding influence that is
       given to the woman as the "mother of all living," coming
       without observation, but making far more strongly than any
       external power for the kingdom of love and light? Truly we
       have a goodly heritage if only we had eyes to see it. Alas!
       that we should have made so little <a name="Page_167"
       id="Page_167"></a>comparative use of it in these great moral
       questions. Alas! that we should have to acknowledge the
       truth and justice of the poet's words:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">Ah, wasteful woman! she who
            may<br /></span> <span class="i0">On her sweet self set
            her own price,<br /></span> <span class="i0">Knowing he
            cannot choose but pay&mdash;<br /></span>
            <span class="i0">How has she cheapen'd
            Paradise,<br /></span> <span class="i0">How given for
            nought her priceless gift,<br /></span>
            <span class="i0">How spoiled the bread and spilt the
            wine,<br /></span> <span class="i0">Which, spent with
            due respective thrift,<br /></span>
            <span class="i0">Had made brutes men, and men
            divine!"<a name="FNanchor_33_33"
               id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33"
               class="fnanchor">[33]</a><br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But even here is there not place for a hopeful thought, that
    if women have made so little comparative use of their well-nigh
    irresistible influence in setting a high standard and shaping
    men to a diviner and less animal type, it has been, as I have
    already said, chiefly owing to ignorance? The whole of one of
    the darkest sides of life has been sedulously kept from us.
    Educated mothers, till lately, have been profoundly ignorant of
    the moral evils of schools, and have never dreamt that that
    young, frank, fresh-faced lad of theirs had any temptations of
    the kind. Their moral influence, which the poet blames them so
    strongly for misusing, has been largely, at least with good
    women, not so much a misused as an undirected force, and we
    know not, therefore, what that force may accomplish when a
    larger and truer knowledge enables it to be persistently
    <a name="Page_168"
       id="Page_168"></a>directed to a conscious aim. This fact, at
       least, has been stamped into my inmost being, that men will
       rise to any moral standard which women choose to set
       them.</p>

    <p>I ask, therefore, cannot we get our girls to help us here
    more than we do, without being crippled by the fear of
    initiating them too much in the evil of the world or destroying
    that unconscious virginal purity which is, even as things are,
    so strong and pathetic an influence for good over young
    men?</p>

    <p>In the addresses that I have given to large numbers of
    educated girls, I used often to begin by quoting a passage from
    the Jewish Prayer-Book. In a general thanksgiving for the
    mercies of life, the men say: "We thank Thee, O Lord of heaven
    and earth, that Thou hast not made us a woman." One a little
    wonders how the poor women could join in this thanksgiving. But
    in one corner of the page there is a little rubric in very
    small print which directs, "Here shall the women say: 'We thank
    Thee, O Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast made us
    according unto Thy will!'" And, looking upon that bed of spring
    flowers before me, I used to tell them that it made me feel
    what a fair and gracious and beautiful thing it was to be made
    according unto God's will, to be made a woman.</p>

    <p>Now, in the first place, could we not get them to realize
    this great truth a little more than they do, and not in their
    heart of hearts to wish that they were men? Could we not get
    them to realize a little more the divine <a name="Page_169"
       id="Page_169"></a>possibilities of their womanhood, and
       instead of making it their ambition to figure as a weaker
       form of man, and become lawyers, stockbrokers, and other
       queer things the modern woman is striving after, to make it
       their ambition to become stronger and truer women?</p>

    <p>But how is this to be done? I remember on one occasion, when
    I was going in the evening to address a mass meeting of
    working-class girls, a stout, middle-aged lady bustling up to
    me in a morning conference we were holding, and exclaiming:
    "And what are you going to say to them? What can you say to
    them, except to tell them to take care of themselves and keep
    the men at arm's length?"</p>

    <p>Now, this old-fashioned method, which we have adopted in
    dealing with the girls of the poor, I contend traverses the
    central and most fundamental facts of a woman's being. A woman
    will never find salvation in being told to take care of
    herself, and least of all for the purpose of keeping the man,
    for whom she was created to be a helpmate, at arm's length.
    Gospels of self-culture may take seeming root here and there in
    the exotic woman; but even in her, at some moment of swift
    passion or strong emotion, they will crumple up and fall off
    from her like a withered leaf. James Hinton knew a woman's
    nature but too well when he said that she would respond to the
    appeal "Lay down your life" more readily and more surely than
    to the appeal "Take up your rights." She certainly has a
    <a name="Page_170"
       id="Page_170"></a>most divine power of flinging herself
       away, whether nobly or ignobly, which forms both her
       strength and her weakness. But I have never yet known a
       woman who would not, at any rate to some degree, respond to
       an appeal to save, not herself, but another: "Do not let him
       do this wrong thing, for his sake. You can do anything you
       like with a man who loves you. God has given him body and
       soul into your hands, and you can lift him up into something
       of His image and make a true man of him; or you can let his
       love for you sink him into a selfish beast of prey. Do not
       let him do anything that will for ever lower his manhood,
       but use your power over him to keep him true to all that is
       best and highest in him." I have never yet known the woman
       who will not be moved by such an appeal as this. In other
       words, the central motive force of a woman's nature, the key
       of her whole being, is, and must ever be, the mother in her,
       that divine motherhood which is at the heart of every woman
       worthy of the name, married or unmarried. It is this divine
       motherhood, which all evolution, the whole "process of the
       suns," has gone to strengthen, and which Christianity has
       enshrined at her very heart&mdash;it is this that makes her
       for ever the Christ factor in the world, the supreme
       expression of the redeeming Love&mdash;that care of the
       strong for the weak which even in Nature comes trembling
       into existence beneath the tender wing of the nesting bird,
       or forces itself into notice in the fierce
       <a name="Page_171"
       id="Page_171"></a>lioness's care for her whelps, and which
       we believe will work out the ultimate consummation of the
       "whole creation that groaneth and travaileth in pain until
       now." And I contend that if we are to have in the future
       such women as Lady Augusta Stanley, round whose lifeless
       form were united in one common sorrow the Queen on her
       throne and the poorest of the poor, such women as Browning's
       wife and Browning's mother, of whom he used to say, with a
       slight tremor in his voice, "She was a divine woman," it
       will be by strengthening and appealing to this element of
       divine motherhood in a woman's nature.</p>

    <p>What I would, therefore, teach the girls is this: that they
    have got to mother the boys, that they are the guardians of all
    that is best and highest in them, of all that makes for the
    chivalrous American gentleman, and that their womanhood should
    therefore be to them a fountain of fine manners, of high
    thoughts, and noble actions. I would rub into their very bones,
    if I could, the old saw I have already quoted: "A man is what a
    woman makes him"; that if there were more high womanhood there
    would be less low manhood; and that if the boys are rude and
    rough and slangy, and loutish in their manner to women, the
    blame lies with their sisters who, in their foolish fondness
    and indulgence, or in their boyish camaraderie, have allowed
    them to slouch up into a slovenly manhood. The man at most is
    the fine prose of life, but the woman ought <a name="Page_172"
       id="Page_172"></a>to be its poetry and inspiration. It is
       her hand that sets its key, whether</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"To feed the high tradition of the
            world,"<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>or add to its low discords. Surely Ruskin's noble words
    apply here: "It is the type of an eternal truth that the soul's
    armor is never well set to the heart unless a woman's hand has
    braced it; and it is only when she has braced it loosely that
    the honor of manhood fails"; or those other still stronger and
    nobler words of Frederick Robertson's: "There are two rocks in
    a man's life on which he must either anchor or split: God and
    Woman."</p>

    <p>And could we not appeal to our girls to make their womanhood
    a rock which bears a light to all in peril on the rough sea of
    life&mdash;a light to save from moral shipwreck and lead to the
    safe haven beneath the Rock of Ages? Surely we might appeal to
    them, in the name of their own brothers and others with whom
    they are intimately thrown, to work out these higher
    possibilities of their own womanhood; not to lower it by
    picking up slang words from their brothers&mdash;a woman ought
    to be above coarsening and vulgarizing God's great gift of
    speech&mdash;not to engage in games or romps that involve a
    rude rough-and-tumble with boys, which may develop a healthy
    hoyden, but is utterly destructive of the gracious dignity of
    the true woman; not to adopt fast ways of either dress or
    bearing which <a name="Page_173"
       id="Page_173"></a>lead to young men making remarks behind
       their backs which they ought not to make on any woman; above
       all, never in girlish flightiness, or, worse still, in order
       to boast of the number of offers they have received, to
       flirt or trifle in any way with a man's affections; but to
       remember that to every man they have to make a woman only
       the other name for truth and constancy. God only knows the
       number of young men who have received their first downward
       bent from what to a young girl, in the wilfulness of her
       high spirits and her ignorance of life, has been only a bit
       of fun, but which to the young man has been the first fatal
       break in his faith in woman&mdash;that faith which in his
       soul dwells so hard by his faith in the Divine that in
       making shipwreck of the one is only too likely to make
       shipwreck of the other.</p>

    <p>As to the mothers who send out their young girls into
    society the victims of their fashionable dressmakers, to be a
    fountain, not of high, pure thoughts to young men, but a spring
    of low temptations and impure suggestions, I do not blame the
    young girls here; but surely the severest blame is due to the
    criminal folly, or worse, of their mothers, who must know what
    the consequences of immodest dressing necessarily are to the
    inflammable mind of youth.</p>

    <p>But that that unlovely phenomenon "the girl of the period,"
    is also deeply to blame for the lowered traditions of English
    society, and consequently of English <a name="Page_174"
       id="Page_174"></a>manhood, I have only too sorrowfully to
       acknowledge. I remember Mrs. Herbert of Vauxhall telling a
       very fashionable audience how on one occasion she had to
       rebuke a young man moving in the first London society for
       using some contemptuous expression with regard to women, and
       was led to appeal very earnestly to him to reverence all
       women for his mother's sake. He turned upon her with a sort
       of divine rage and said: "I long to reverence women, but the
       girls I meet with in society won't let me. They like me to
       make free with them; they like me to talk to them about
       doubtful subjects, and they make me"&mdash;and he ground his
       teeth as he said it&mdash;"what I just hate myself for
       being." Alas! alas! can sadder words knell in a woman's ears
       than these?</p>

    <p>But side by side with this desecrating womanhood there rises
    up before me the vision of a young girl, not English, nor
    American, but French&mdash;now a mature woman, with girls and
    boys of her own, but who in her young days was the very
    embodiment of all that I have been urging that our girls might
    become to their brothers. She was a daughter of the great
    French preacher, Frederick Monod, and had an only brother who
    was all in all to her. She knew enough of the evil of the world
    to know that a medical student in Paris was exposed to great
    temptations; and she was resolved, so far as she could, to make
    her womanhood a crystal shield between him and them. She
    entered <a name="Page_175"
       id="Page_175"></a>into all his pursuits; she took an
       interest in all his friends and companions; she had always
       leisure for sympathy and counsel in his difficulties and
       troubles. She had a little room of her own to which she used
       to get him to come every evening and talk over the day with
       her, so that she might keep herself heart to heart with him
       in all that concerned him. She even overcame her girlish
       reserve, and would get him to kneel down by her side and
       pour out her sweet girlish heart in prayer that God would
       guide him in all his ways, and keep him unspotted from the
       world. Years after, when he was a married man, with boys of
       his own, he said to her: "You little know all that you were
       to me as a young man. My temptations were so maddening that
       I used sometimes to think that I must yield to them and do
       as other young men did all round me. But then a vision of
       you used to rise up before me, and I used to say to myself:
       'No; if I do this thing, I can never go and sit with her in
       her own little room; I can never look into her dear face
       again.'" And the thought of that young girl, the angel of
       her presence in the midst of the furnace, kept that young
       man unspotted from the world through all the gutters of
       Paris life. Could not our sweet English and American girls
       be to their brothers what that young French girl was to
       hers?</p>

    <p>But perhaps some pessimistic mother will exclaim, "What is
    the use of making these old-fashioned <a name="Page_176"
       id="Page_176"></a>appeals to our modern girls? They are so
       taken up with the delights of their freedom, so absorbed in
       the pleasure of cycling and athletic games, so full of manly
       ambitions, so persuaded that the proper cultivated attitude
       is to be an agnostic, and to look at God and the universe
       through a sceptical and somewhat supercilious eyeglass, that
       if we did make an appeal to them such as you suggest they
       would only laugh at such old-fashioned notions." I can only
       say that I have not found it so. I can bear the highest
       testimony at least to our English girls, of whom I have
       addressed thousands, all over the three kingdoms.
       Occasionally it has happened that maturer women have left me
       stranded, stretching out hands of vain appeal to them; but
       my girls, my dear girls, never once failed me. Not only
       could I see by the expression of their faces how deeply they
       responded to my appeal to work out the latent possibilities
       of their womanhood, and be the uplifting influence to their
       brothers, and other young men with whom they were thrown,
       that a true woman can be; but they came forward in troops to
       take up the position I assigned to them in our woman's
       movement towards a higher and purer life. Nobly did those
       young girls respond, joining a movement for opening
       club-rooms and classes for working girls, a movement
       initiated not by me, but by educated girls like themselves,
       and which has since spread all over England and
       Scotland.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_177"
       id="Page_177"></a>And if this is true of our English girls,
       still more would it be true of the American girl, who has a
       unique position and influence of her own, and is dowered
       with that peculiar capacity and graciousness which seem to
       belong by divine right to the American woman.</p>

    <p>I cannot but think that if we were to teach our girls less
    in religious phraseology and more from the great realities of
    life; if they were taught that Christianity is only human life
    rightly seen and divinely ordered, that the Cross is only the
    uncovering of what is going on all round us, though hidden to a
    careless gaze,&mdash;the sin, the pain, the misery, which are
    forever crucifying and forever calling forth that great passion
    of redeeming Love to which, through the motherhood that is in
    us, "one touch of nature makes us kin"; and that the central
    truth of Christianity is not, as we have too often taught,
    saving our own souls, but a life poured out for the good of
    others, and personal salvation as a means for having a life to
    pour forth&mdash;I cannot but think that much fashionable
    girlish agnosticism would disappear, and the true woman would
    reach forth to that divine humanity to which she belongs.</p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX"
       id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

    <h3>THE MODERN WOMAN AND HER FUTURE</h3>

    <p>Up to this point I have dealt only with the great shaping
    and moulding principles of life, with indirect influence rather
    than direct. How far direct teaching on matters of sex should
    be given to our girls has been a far greater perplexity to me
    than in the case of boys. In the present state of our schools
    and our streets our boys must get to know evil. Hitherto it was
    possible to say that our girls <i>might</i> get to know evil,
    and between that "must" and "might" lay a great and perplexing
    chasm. We do not want our garden lilies to smell of anything
    but pure dews and rains and sun-warmed fragrance. But is this
    ideal possible any longer, except in a few secluded country
    homes, where, hidden like Keats's nightingale "among the
    leaves," they may remain innocent and ignorant of the world's
    evil?</p>

    <p>But with the ordinary conditions of the present day, with
    the greater freedom accorded to women, the wider range of
    education, involving a wider range of reading, with modern
    newspapers left about, I ask, How is it possible for a mother
    to keep her girls in ignorance and <a name="Page_179"
       id="Page_179"></a>unconscious innocence? A volume of short
       stories comes into the house from the circulating library;
       they are clever and apparently absolutely harmless. Yet
       embedded in the heart of one such volume, which shall be
       nameless, I came upon a story almost as vile as anything in
       a French novel, and conveying the most corrupt knowledge.
       How, I ask, can a busy mother read through every book of
       short stories before letting it fall into the hands of her
       girls; or how, if they are to read Latin and Greek, or even
       carefully to study our own old literature, is she to guard
       them from a knowledge of evil conveyed in classical
       allusions, or in the coarse plainness of speech of an
       earlier age? I know as a fact, whether we recognize it or
       not, that behind our mature backs our girls are discussing
       these moral problems with quite an alarming amount of
       freedom, and some at least, guided by no teaching, and with
       no practical knowledge of the great laws of human life, are
       coming to quite startling conclusions, which would make
       their mothers' hair stand on end. And one most undesirable,
       and I may add unnatural, result noticeable among the more
       advanced section is a certain distaste for marriage, a
       tendency to look upon it as something low and animal, which
       strikes me as simply a fatal attitude for women to take
       up.</p>

    <p>Have we not, therefore, got clearly to recognize that the
    old order has changed, giving place to new, and requiring,
    therefore, new methods. We may or we <a name="Page_180"
       id="Page_180"></a>may not like the new order, but it is
       <i>there</i>. Under the changed conditions of modern life it
       is inevitable; therefore it must be in the providence of
       God; it cannot be wholly bad, and if we will work in with it
       loyally, and not thrust it aside for some old order of our
       own, it may be, nay, it will be, wholly for good. Let us
       remember that the two most conservative organic forms, the
       two that have most resisted progressive evolution, are the
       donkey and the goose. To ignore the new order, to cling to
       the old views and methods, is to court moral extinction as a
       living force. As well think to find safety in escaping from
       the advance of an express engine by adopting the stately
       pace of our grandmothers, which was perfectly adapted for
       getting out of the way of a lumbering stage-coach. May not
       He</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"Whose large plan ripens slowly to a
            whole"<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>be working out a progressive ideal such as we trace in the
    great spiritual records of our race? The Bible, thank God!
    neither begins nor ends with sin; but it begins with a sinless
    garden, it ends with a strong city of God, with evil known and
    recognized, but cast out beyond its walls. May He not be
    leading us to form a wiser, deeper, stronger ideal; to aim for
    our girls not so much at Innocence, with her fading wreath of
    flowers&mdash;fading, as, alas! they must ever fade in a world
    like this&mdash;but to aim at Virtue, with her victor's crown
    of <a name="Page_181"
       id="Page_181"></a>gold, tried in the fire? May it not be
       that His divine providence is constraining us to take as our
       ideal for our womanhood, not the old sheltered garden, but a
       strong city of God, having foundations, whose very gates are
       made of pearl, through which nothing that defileth is
       suffered to enter, and whose common ways are paved with pure
       gold, gold of no earthly temper, but pure and clear as
       crystal;&mdash;a city of refuge for all who are oppressed
       with wrong, and from which all foul forms of evil are banned
       by the one word "<i>Without</i>"? Sure I am that if we will
       accept this deeper and larger ideal, and endeavor, however
       imperfectly, to work it out on the earth, in the midst of
       it, as in the old garden ideal, will be found the tree of
       life; but then its very leaves will be for the healing of
       the nations.</p>

    <p>But whether you go with me as far as this or not, I think
    you will agree with me that we must not leave our girls to
    their own crude notions on the deepest matters of life. Still
    less must we leave them to get their teaching on marriage and
    matters of sex from some modern novels, which I can only
    characterize as tuberculosis of the moral sense, but from
    which, as I have already pointed out, we cannot always guard
    them. We must give them direct teaching of some kind.</p>

    <p>First, I think our girls, as well as our boys, need far more
    direct teaching than has been customary as to the sanctity of
    the body. This is especially true of <a name="Page_182"
       id="Page_182"></a>girls who are sent to boarding-schools, as
       some of the moral evils of boys' schools are not, I am sorry
       to say, altogether unknown in girls' schools, though, as far
       as I can ascertain, the evil is much less in extent, and in
       some is non-existent. Still, all girls need to be taught
       that the body is the temple of the Lord and Giver of life,
       and that from the crown of their heads to the sole of their
       feet those bodies belong to Christ.</p>

    <p>Secondly, I think that they ought to have some such teaching
    about life and birth as that which I have already recommended
    for boys, that they may see how through the marital tie and the
    consequent rise of the parental relation, a world of blind
    mechanical force gradually developed into a world of life and
    beauty, and at last crowned itself with a conscious love in an
    indissoluble union, which makes marriage the very type of the
    union of the soul with God, of Christ with His Church.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, they need to be taught that much in their own
    physical constitution, which they rebel against as handicapping
    them in the struggle of life, is Nature's provision for them
    that no merely physical function should press upon them as we
    see it do in the animal creation at certain periods of the
    year, but that they should be free to serve God, whether in the
    married or in the unmarried state, in quietness and godly
    living.</p>

    <p>Fourthly, above all they need definite teaching on
    <a name="Page_183"
       id="Page_183"></a>the true nature, the sanctity, and the
       beauty of marriage. It appears that the line of progress is
       always a spiral, and it would seem as if we were in the
       backward sweep of the spiral which looks like retrogression,
       but will doubtless bring us out further up in the end. The
       masculine view that marriage is the one aim and end of a
       woman's existence, adopted also by some careful mothers, is
       now exploded. Young men are no longer led to look upon every
       girl that they meet as furtively, to use a vulgarism,
       "setting her cap for him," and only too ready to fling
       herself at his feet. So far so good. But have we not
       suffered our girls to drift into the opposite extreme? In
       the heyday of their bright young life, with so many new
       interests and amusements open to them, in the pride of their
       freedom and independence, they are no longer so inclined to
       marry, and are even apt to look down upon the married state.
       They form so high an ideal of the man to whom they would
       surrender their independence&mdash;an ideal which they
       fortunately do not apply to their fathers and brothers, whom
       they find it quite possible to love on a far lower and more
       human level&mdash;that because a man does not fulfil this
       ideal, and is not a fairy prince dowered with every possible
       gift, they refuse men who, though not angels, would have
       made them happy as wife and mother. Would not a little
       sound, sensible teaching be of great good here? Could we not
       point out that, though in so vital and complex a union as
       the <a name="Page_184"
       id="Page_184"></a>family there must be some seat of ultimate
       authority, some court of final appeal somewhere, and that
       the woman herself would not wish it to rest anywhere else
       than in the man, if she is to respect him; yet there is no
       subservience on the part of the wife in the obedience she
       renders, but rather in South's grand words, "It is that of a
       queen to her king, who both owns a subjection and remains a
       majesty"? Cannot we contend against this falsehood of the
       age which seems so to underlie our modern life, and which
       inclines us to look upon all obedience as a slavish
       thing&mdash;that obedience which "doth preserve the stars
       from wrong," and through which "the most ancient heavens are
       fresh and strong"; that obedience which when absolute and
       implicit to the Divine will is "a service of perfect
       freedom"? It is the profession which exacts unquestionable
       obedience that forms the finest school for character, as I
       have already pointed out. We do not hear of a Wellington or
       a Roberts refusing to enter the service because they could
       not give up their independence. Our military heroes at least
       know that it is through discipline and obedience that they
       gain their real independence&mdash;the independence of a
       strong character.</p>

    <p>Again, our girls need to be taught not only that there is
    nothing derogatory in the married relation to the freest and
    fullest independence of character, but surely in these days of
    open advocacy by some popular writers of "les unions libres"
    and a freedom of <a name="Page_185"
       id="Page_185"></a>divorce that comes to much the same thing,
       they need to be taught the sanctity of marriage&mdash;those
       first principles which hitherto we have taken for granted,
       but which now, like everything else, is thrown into the
       crucible and brought into question. They need definite
       teaching as to the true nature of marriage; that it is no
       mere contract to be broken or kept according to the
       individual contractor's convenience&mdash;I never yet heard
       of a contract for bringing into existence, not a successful
       machine, but a moral and spiritual being with infinite
       possibilities of weal or woe, of heaven or hell&mdash;but a
       sacramental union of love and life, with sacramental grace
       given to those who will seek it to live happily and endure
       nobly within its sacred bounds&mdash;a union so deep and
       mystical that even on its physical side our great
       physiologists are wholly at a loss to account for some of
       its effects;<a name="FNanchor_34_34"
       id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34"
       class="fnanchor">[34]</a> a union of which permanence is the
       very essence, as on its permanence rests the permanence and
       stability of the whole fabric of our life. It can never be
       treated on an individualistic basis, though that is always
       the tendency with every man and woman who has ever loved. In
       Mrs. Humphry Ward's words:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"That is always the way; each man imagines the matter is
        still for his deciding, and he can no more decide it than
        he can tamper with the fact that fire burns or water
        drowns. All these centuries the human animal has fought
        with the human soul. <a name="Page_186"
           id="Page_186"></a>And step by step the soul has
           registered her victories. She has won them only by
           feeling for the law and finding it&mdash;uncovering,
           bringing into light the firm rocks beneath her feet. And
           on these rocks she rears her landmarks&mdash;marriage,
           the family, the State, the Church. Neglect them and you
           sink into the quagmire from which the soul of the race
           has been for generations struggling to save
           you."<a name="FNanchor_35_35"
           id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35"
           class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>Fall on this rock, stumble into unhappiness and discontent,
    as so many do in marriage, and you will be broken. But be
    faithful to it and to the high traditions which generations of
    suffering men and women have worked out for you, and you will
    be broken as the bud is broken into the blossom, as the acorn
    is broken into the oak&mdash;broken into a higher and stronger
    life. On the other hand rebel against it, attempt to drag it
    down or cast it from its place, and it will crush you, and
    grind some part of your higher nature to powder. How strangely
    and sadly is this shown in the case of one of our greatest
    writers, who thought that the influence of her writings would
    far outweigh the influence of her example, but whose name and
    example are now constantly used by bad men to overcome the
    virtue of young educated girls struggling alone in London, and
    often half starving on the miserable pittance which is all they
    can earn. But still more is it shown in the life of the nation
    which tampers with the laws of marriage and admits freedom of
    divorce. Either such suits must <a name="Page_187"
       id="Page_187"></a>be heard <i>in camera</i> without the
       shame of exposure, when divorce is so facilitated that the
       family and the State rest rather on a superstructure of
       rickety boards than on a rock; or they must be heard in
       public court and form a moral sewer laid on to the whole
       nation, poisoning the deepest springs of its life, and
       through that polluted life producing far more individual
       misery than it endeavors to remedy in dissolving an unhappy
       marriage. God only knows what I suffered when a <i>cause
       célèbre</i> came on, and I felt that the whole nation was
       being provided with something worse and more vitally
       mischievous than the most corrupt French novel.</p>

    <p>Deeply do I regret&mdash;and in this I think most thoughtful
    minds will agree with me&mdash;that the Reformers in their
    inevitable rebound from the superstitions of Rome, rejected her
    teaching of the sacramental nature of marriage, which has made
    so many Protestant nations tend to that freedom of divorce
    which is carried to so great an extent in some parts of
    America, and is spreading, alas! to many of our own
    colonies&mdash;a laxity fatally undermining the sanctity and
    stability of the family. If marriage be not a sacrament, an
    outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual life and
    grace, I ask what is?</p>

    <p>I would therefore earnestly beseech you to oppose your
    direct teaching to the whole tendency of modern life, and to
    much of the direct teaching of modern fiction
    &mdash;<a name="Page_188"
       id="Page_188"></a>even of so great a novelist as George
       Meredith&mdash;which inculcates the subordination of the
       marriage bond to what is called the higher law of love, or
       rather, passion. In teaching your sons, and especially your
       girls, who are far more likely to be led astray by this
       specious doctrine, base marriage not on emotion, not on
       sentiment, but on duty. To build upon emotion, with the
       unruly wills and affections of sinful men, is to build, not
       upon the sand, but upon the wind. There is but one immovable
       rock on which steadfast character, steadfast relations,
       steadfast subordination of the lower and personal desires,
       to the higher and immutable obligations and trusts and
       responsibilities of life can be built&mdash;duty. When this
       rock has been faithfully clung to, when in the midst of
       disillusionment and shattered ideals the noble resolution
       has been clung to never to base personal happiness on a
       broken trust or another's pain, I have over and over again
       known the, most imperfect marriage prove in the end to be
       happy and contented. Here again I quote some words of
       Mrs.</p>

    <p>Humphry Ward, which she puts into the mouth of her hero:
    "No," he said with deep emphasis&mdash;"No; I have come to
    think the most disappointing and hopeless marriage, nobly
    borne, to be better worth having than what people call an
    'ideal passion'&mdash;if the ideal passion must be enjoyed at
    the expense of one of those fundamental rules which poor human
    nature has worked out, with such infinite difficulty and pain,
    for <a name="Page_189"
       id="Page_189"></a>the protection and help of its own
       weakness,"<a name="FNanchor_36_36"
       id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36"
       class="fnanchor">[36]</a> I am aware that neither Mr. Grant
       Allen with his "hill-top" novels, nor Mrs. Mona Caird need
       be taken too seriously, but when the latter says, "There is
       something pathetically absurd in this sacrifice to their
       children of generation after generation of grown
       people,"<a name="FNanchor_37_37"
       id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37"
       class="fnanchor">[37]</a> I would suggest that it would be
       still more pathetically absurd to see the whole
       upward-striving past, the whole noble future of the human
       race, sacrificed to their unruly wills and affections, their
       passions and desires. If as Goldwin Smith says in his rough,
       incisive way, "There is not much union of heart in marriage,
       I do not see that there would be any more union of heart in
       adultery."</p>

    <p>I have dwelt thus earnestly upon this point because the
    sooner we realize for ourselves and our girls that any
    relaxation of the marriage bond will in its disastrous
    consequences fall upon us, and not upon men, the better. It is
    the woman who first grows old and loses her personal
    attractions, while a man often preserves his beauty into
    extreme old age. It is the burdened mother of a family who
    cannot compete in companionship with the highly cultured young
    unmarried lady, with the leisure to post herself up in the last
    interesting book or the newest political movement. It is the
    man who is the more variable in his affections than
    <a name="Page_190"
       id="Page_190"></a>the woman; more constant as she is by
       nature, as well as firmly anchored down by the strength of
       her maternal love. It is therefore on the woman that any
       loosening of the permanence of the marriage tie will chiefly
       fall in untold suffering. "Le mariage c'est la justice," say
       the French, who have had experience enough of "les unions
       libres"&mdash;justice to the wife and mother, securing her
       the stability of her right to her husband's affections, the
       stability to her right of maintenance after she has given up
       her means of support, above all, the stability of her right
       to the care of her own children. If we want to study the
       innate misery to women arising from the relaxation of the
       married tie, or transient unions, we had better read
       Professor Dowden's <i>Life of Shelley</i>&mdash;misery not
       the result of public stigma, for there was no such stigma in
       the circle in which Shelley moved, but misery brought about
       by the facts themselves, and producing state of things which
       Matthew Arnold could only characterize by the untranslatable
       French word "<i>sale</i>." But nearer home, one of your most
       brilliant writers, Mr. Henry James, has given us an equally
       profitable study in his novelette, <i>What Maisie Knew</i>,
       which I presume is intended as a satire on freedom of
       divorce, but which again can only be characterized by the
       French word "<i>sale</i>."</p>

    <p>I confess it does fill me with sardonic laughter to find
    this oldest and stalest of all experiments, this oldest and
    flattest of failures, paraded as a brand new <a name="Page_191"
       id="Page_191"></a>and original panacea for all the woes of
       our family life,&mdash;woes which, if nobly borne, at least
       make "perfect through suffering."</p>

    <p>There is but one great rock-hewn dam successfully reared
    against the lawless passions of men and women, and that is
    Christian marriage. It has at least given us the Christian
    home, and pure family life. And sometimes it fills me with
    despair to see enlightened nations, like America and Australia,
    whittling away and slowly undermining this great bulwark
    against the devastating sea of human passion. If only I could
    feel that any poor words of mine could in any faint measure
    rouse American women to set themselves against what must in the
    end affect the depth and steadfastness of those family
    affections on which the beauty and solidity of the national
    character mainly rest, I should feel indeed I had not lived in
    vain.</p>

    <p>At least I can claim that one of your greatest women,
    Frances Willard, was heart and soul with me on this point.</p>

    <p>And now to descend to lower levels. Could we not do a little
    more to save our young girls from sacrificing their happiness
    to false ideals by opportunely obtruding a little mature
    common-sense into their day visions and their inexperienced way
    of looking at things? It is all very well in the heyday of
    life, when existence is full of delight and home affection, to
    refuse a man who could make them happy, because they don't
    quite like <a name="Page_192"
       id="Page_192"></a>the shape of his nose, or because he is a
       little untidy in his dress, or simply because they are
       waiting for some impossible demigod to whom alone they could
       surrender their independence. But could we not mildly point
       out that darker days must come, when life will not be all
       enjoyment, and that a lonely old age, with only too possible
       penury to be encountered, must be taken into
       consideration?</p>

    <p>God knows I am no advocate for loveless, and least of all
    for mercenary marriages, but I think we want some <i>viâ
    media</i> between the French <i>mariage de convenance</i> and
    our English and American method of leaving so grave a question
    as marriage entirely to the whimsies and romantic fancies of
    young girls. We need not go back to the old fallacy that
    marriage is the aim and end of a woman's existence, and
    absolutely necessary for her happiness. Some women are
    doubtless called to be mothers of the race, and to do the
    social work which is so necessary to our complex civilization.
    Some women may feel themselves called to some literary or
    artistic pursuit, or some other profession, for which they
    require the freedom of unmarried life. But I think I shall
    carry most women with me in saying that for the ordinary woman
    marriage is the happiest state, and that she rarely realizes
    the deepest and highest in her nature except in wifehood and
    motherhood. Rarely, indeed, can any public work that she can do
    for the world equal the value of that priceless work of
    building <a name="Page_193"
       id="Page_193"></a>up, stone by stone, the temple of a good
       man's character which falls to the lot of his mother. Truly
       is she called the wife, the weaver, since day and night,
       without hasting and without resting, she is weaving the
       temple hangings, wrought about with pomegranates and lilies,
       of the very shrine of his being. And if our girls could be
       led to see this, at least it would overcome that adverseness
       to marriage which many are now so curiously showing, and
       which inevitably makes them more fastidious and fanciful in
       their choice, And, on the other hand, without falling back
       into the old match-making mamma, exposing her wares in the
       marriage market to be knocked down to the highest bidder,
       might not parents recognize a little more than they do how
       incumbent on them it is to make every effort to give their
       daughters that free and healthy intercourse with young men
       which would yield them a wider choice, and which forms the
       best method for insuring a happy marriage?</p>

    <p>At least, let us open our eyes to the fact that we are face
    to face with some terrible problems with regard to the future
    of our girls. With safe investments yielding less and less
    interest, it must become more and more difficult to make a
    provision for the unmarried daughters; and if the money is
    spent instead on training them to earn their own bread, we are
    still met by the problem of the early superannuation of women's
    labor, which rests on physical causes, and cannot therefore be
    <a name="Page_194"
       id="Page_194"></a>removed. This at least is no time to
       despise marriage, or for women of strong and independent
       character to adopt an attitude which deprives the nation of
       many of its noblest mothers.</p>

    <p>But if we are to facilitate marriage, which must form, at
    any rate, the main solution of the problems of the near future
    to which I have alluded, if we are to prevent, or even lessen,
    the degradation of women, if we are to extinguish this pit of
    destruction in our midst, into which so many a fair and
    promising young life disappears, and which perpetually
    threatens the moral and physical welfare of our own sons, if we
    are to stay the seeds of moral decay in our own nation, we must
    be content to revolutionize much in the order of our own life,
    and adopt a lower and simpler standard of living. It is we, and
    not men, who set the standard; it is we who have been guilty of
    the vulgar ambition of following the last social fashion, and
    doing as our richer neighbors do, until in England we have made
    our girls such expensive articles that many young men simply
    dare not indulge in them, and are led to seek in their
    luxurious clubs the comfort which they should find in a home of
    their own, with all that relaxation of moral fibre which comes
    from club life. Do we seriously think that we are likely
    successfully to contend against the degradation of women by our
    Rescue Societies and our Refuges when we are deliberately
    bringing about a social condition that ministers to
    it?<a name="Page_195"
       id="Page_195"></a> "Oh, of course," said a near relative of
       my own, "no girl can marry comfortably and live in London
       with less than a thousand a year." All I can answer is that
       if this be so, it means the degradation of women writ
       large.</p>

    <p>And have we even secured the happiness of our own daughters
    by this high standard of living which prevents so many of them
    from marrying at all? These unmarried girls, with no worthy
    object in life to call out the noble energies that lie dormant
    within them, "lasting" rather than "living,"&mdash;are they
    really happy? Is not Robert Louis Stevenson right when he says
    that "the ideal of the stalled ox is the one ideal that will
    never satisfy either man or woman"? Were not the hardships of a
    smaller income and a larger life&mdash;a life that would at
    least satisfy a woman's worst foe, heart hunger,&mdash;more
    adapted to their true nature, their true happiness?</p>

    <p>And to what further admirable results have we attained by
    this high standard of comfort and luxury? Nature has carefully
    provided for the equality of the sexes by sending rather more
    boys than girls into the world, since fewer boys are reared;
    but we have managed to derange this order. We have sent our
    boys out into the world, but we have kept our girls at home,
    refusing to allow them to rough it with husbands and brothers
    or to endure the least hardness. The consequence is that we
    have nearly a million of surplus women in the old country,
    while in America, and in our <a name="Page_196"
       id="Page_196"></a>own colonies, we have a corresponding
       surplus of men, with all the evil moral consequences that
       belong to a disproportion between the sexes. Truly we may
       congratulate ourselves!</p>

    <p>I would therefore urge that if we are really to grapple with
    these moral evils, we should simplify our standard of living,
    and educate our girls very differently to what, at least in
    England, we are doing. Culture is good, and the more we have of
    it the better; it gives a woman a wider sphere of influence, as
    well as more enlightened methods of using that influence. But
    if dead languages are to take the place of living service; if
    high mathematics are to work out a low plane of cooking and
    household management; if a first class in moral science is to
    involve third class performance of the moral duties involved in
    family life, then I deliberately say it were better that, like
    Tennyson's mother, we should be</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"Not learned save in gracious
            household ways."<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>I protest with the uttermost earnestness against the care of
    human life, of human health, and of human comfort being
    considered a lower thing and of less importance than good
    scholarship; or that, when we recognize that months and even
    years will have to be devoted to the attainment of the one, the
    arts by which we can fulfil those great human trusts which
    devolve more or less upon every woman can be practised without
    ever having been learnt at all.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_197"
       id="Page_197"></a>Do not misunderstand me. Do not think I am
       decrying a classical education; and, as the daughter of a
       great mathematician, it is not likely that I should
       underrate mathematics as a mental discipline. I am only
       urging that they should be subordinated to higher and more
       practical issues.</p>

    <p>I am thankfully aware that these remarks do not apply to
    American women to the same degree in which they apply to our
    English girls. The paucity of domestic servants, and the
    consequent pressure of necessity, have saved you from the fine
    lady ideal which we have adopted for our girls and the
    exclusively book education into which we have almost
    unconsciously drifted. You have been constrained to choose some
    nobler type on which to mould your scheme of female education
    than that of the tadpole, which is all head, no hands, a much
    active and frivolous tail. Your girls are brought up not to
    consider it beneath them to take part in the work of the house;
    and something of the all round capability of American women
    which so strikes us is doubtless owing to their not having
    incurred "this Nemesis of disproportion," and therefore to
    their combining intellectual culture with practical
    efficiency.</p>

    <p>Why we should have taken this fine lady ideal for our girls,
    when we take such a much more practical standard for our boys,
    has always puzzled me. If an excellent opening offered itself
    to one of our sons at a <a name="Page_198"
       id="Page_198"></a>bank, we should agree with his father in
       expecting him to take it, though it would involve the
       drudgery of sitting in a cramped attitude on a tall stool
       for hours and hours every day. Why should we accept life's
       necessary drudgery for our boys and refuse it for our girls?
       No life worth living can be had without drudgery,&mdash;the
       most brilliant as well as the dullest. Darwin spent eight of
       the best years of his life in an exhaustive investigation
       into the organization of a barnacle&mdash;labor accompanied,
       as all intellectual work was with him, by a constant sense
       of physical nausea from which he suffered, till, from sheer
       weariness and disgust at the drudgery, he ends his
       researches in his emphatic way with the exclamation,
       "D&mdash;&mdash; the barnacles!" At least a woman's
       household drudgery does not end in a barnacle, or in dead
       coin, but in a living and loved personality whose comfort
       and health it secures. Blessed is drudgery, the homely
       mother of Patience, "that young and rose-lipped cherubim,"
       of quiet endurance, of persistency in well-doing, of all the
       stablest elements of character.</p>

    <p>Do not let us refuse to our girls the divine hardness which
    is the very heart of a diviner joy and of that "fuller life" of
    "which our veins are scant," nor refuse for them and for
    ourselves the words of life: "As the Father hath sent Me into
    the world, even so send I you"; but be content to send them
    into the world to love, to suffer, to endure, to live and die
    for the good of others.</p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_X"
       id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

    <h3>NATIONAL AND IMPERIAL ASPECTS</h3>

    <p>I cannot conclude these imperfect suggestions as to how we
    may best carry up the moral training of our children, and
    especially of our boys, to a higher level, without touching on
    the wider and national aspect of the problems we have been
    considering. Especially is this necessary in relation to that
    attribute which, in common parlance, arrogates to itself the
    name that covers the vast sweep of all moral obligation and
    calls itself emphatically "morality." "Language," Dr. Martineau
    has finely said, "is the great confessional of the human
    heart"; and it may be in some instinctive sense that this
    question of personal purity or the reverse is the determining
    force for good or evil to the nation, as well as to the family,
    that has given this restricted sense to the words "morality"
    and "immorality." Yet we are possessed with an inveterate and
    almost irreclaimable tendency to look at the question of purity
    of life from a purely individualistic standpoint, and to regard
    it as a matter concerning the individual rather than the social
    organism. In electing a member for the Legislature how often
    have <a name="Page_200"
       id="Page_200"></a>we not been told that we are only
       concerned with his public career, and have nothing whatever
       to do with his private life, though the private life is only
       another expression for the man himself; and how can we be
       called upon to entrust the destinies of our country to a
       libertine who habitually violates the obligations of his own
       manhood and does his best to lower and degrade the womanhood
       of the people he is called as a member of the Legislature to
       protect and to raise? When shall we learn that whatever
       touches the higher life and well-being of the family still
       more vitally affects the wider family of the State, and
       threatens its disintegration? The family in some lower form
       will survive in the most corrupt form of society; but the
       State, as an organized polity, capable of embodying,
       preserving, and promoting the higher life of the nation,
       perishes.</p>

    <p>I am the more led to dwell earnestly on these wider aspects,
    since that great epoch-making commemoration which marked the
    sixtieth year of the reign of our Queen, and which brought home
    to the consciousness of the nation, as nothing else has ever
    done, its vast world-wide responsibilities. That great national
    festival, with its proud imperial note, in which we celebrated
    the rise and progress of that "larger Venice with no narrow
    canals, but the sea itself for streets," will forever form a
    landmark in English history. None who witnessed it will ever
    forget that spectacle, of men of all races and color, of all
    creeds and traditions, <a name="Page_201"
       id="Page_201"></a>assembled together as brothers and
       fellow-subjects, to do honor to a woman's gracious sway of
       sixty years. And is there not a deep significance in the
       fact that these men of warring creeds and opposed traditions
       came together to do homage to no commanding personality, no
       Semiramis or Boadicea of old, no Catherine of Russia or
       Elizabeth of England; but to a sovereign whose chief
       characteristic has been that of being a true woman, with a
       true woman's instinctive sagacity and wisdom of the heart: a
       woman with no glamour of youth and beauty, but bowed with
       the weight of years and widowhood and cares of State; a
       Queen who, on the morning of her crowning triumph, sent
       forth no royal proclamation couched in set and pompous
       periods, but laid her trembling hands on the bowed head of
       her people, and gave them a simple mother's blessing: "Tell
       my beloved people that I pray from the bottom of my heart
       that God may bless them"?</p>

    <p>May I not take it as the very embodiment of all that I have
    been urging on the women of this day, the immense possibilities
    of good that lie latent in our womanhood, the vast issues of
    good to the nation, and through it to the world, if that
    womanhood is only true to itself?</p>

    <p>For let us clearly realize that this great moral question is
    no question confined to the narrow limits of the home, but a
    question of the rise and fall of nations. This is a truism of
    history. All history teaches us that the welfare and very life
    of a nation is determined <a name="Page_202"
       id="Page_202"></a>by moral causes; and that it is the pure
       races that respect their women and guard them jealously from
       defilement that are the tough, prolific, ascendant races,
       the noblest in type and the most fruitful in propagating
       themselves. You will never find a permanently progressive
       race where the position of women is low, the men libertine,
       and the state of society corrupt. What was it that made the
       most brilliant civilization the world has ever
       seen&mdash;the civilization which still gives us the
       inexhaustible wells of our intellectual life&mdash;what was
       it that made it the shortest-lived? Few, I think, would deny
       that the rapid decadence of Greece, despite her splendid
       intellectual life, was due to moral causes. Not the pure,
       but the impure&mdash;the brilliant Hetairæ&mdash;were the
       companions of men, and the men themselves were stained with
       nameless vices. Speaking of the decay of the Athenian
       people, Mr. Francis Galton says: "We know, and may guess
       something more, of the reason why this marvellously gifted
       race declined. Social morality grew exceedingly lax;
       marriage became unfashionable and was avoided; many of the
       more ambitious and accomplished women were avowed
       courtesans, and consequently infertile; and the mothers of
       the incoming population were of a heterogeneous
       class."<a name="FNanchor_38_38"
       id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38"
       class="fnanchor">[38]</a> What was it that made the Egyptian
       civilization one of the longest-lived of ancient
       civilizations? Was it not, as we now find by her monuments,
       <a name="Page_203"
       id="Page_203"></a>that the position of women was high; the
       wife was enthroned by the side of her husband, and impurity
       was condemned by the moral sense of the nation? What was it
       that enabled our barbaric ancestors, the Teutons, to
       overthrow the whole power of civilized Rome? On the
       authority of Tacitus, we know that they were singularly
       pure. Their women were held in the highest reverence, and
       believed to have something divine about them, some breath of
       prophetic insight. Their young men were not allowed to marry
       till they were five-and-twenty&mdash;in other words, till
       their frame was thoroughly matured. Impurity before marriage
       was strongly discountenanced in both sexes. Therefore the
       whole power of Rome, honeycombed as it was by moral
       corruption and sexual vice, could not stand before these
       pure barbarians.</p>

    <p>And if these mighty civilizations have perished from moral
    causes, do we really think that the moral law&mdash;will</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"Of which the solid earth and
            sky<br /></span> <span class="i0">Are but the fitful
            shadows cast on high"&mdash;<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>suspend its operation out of compliment to the greatness of
    the British empire or of the American Republic, if they, too,
    become morally corrupt; or will not those old vanished nations,
    in the magnificent words of the Hebrew prophet, greet the
    phantom of their departed greatness in the land of shadows:
    "What, art thou, also, become weak as we? Art thou also like
    <a name="Page_204"
       id="Page_204"></a>unto us? Thy pomp is brought down to the
       grave; the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover
       thee."</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"We talk of our greatness," says Mr. Froude; "do we
        really know in what a nation's greatness consists? Whether
        it be great or little depends entirely on what sort of men
        and women it is producing. A sound nation is a nation that
        is made up of sound human beings, healthy in body, strong
        of limb, true in word and deed, brave, sober, temperate,
        and chaste, to whom morals are of more importance than
        wealth or knowledge; where duty is first and the rights of
        man are second; where, in short, men grow up, and live, and
        work, having in them what our ancestors called 'the fear of
        God.' It is to form a character of this kind that human
        beings are sent into the world. Unless England's greatness
        in this sense has the principle of growth in it, it were
        better for us that a millstone were hanged about our neck,
        and that we were drowned in the midst of the sea."</p>

        <p>"I feel more and more," said Mrs. Fawcett in words
        addressed to a great meeting of men in the Manchester Free
        Trade Hall&mdash;words that I wish could be written upon
        every heart&mdash;" that the great question whether the
        relations of men and women shall be pure and virtuous or
        impure and vile lies at the root of all national well-being
        and progress. The main requisite towards a better state of
        things than now exists cannot be brought about by any
        outside agency. There is no royal road to virtue and
        purity. Law can do something to punish wickedness, but
        improvement in the law is mainly valuable as an indication
        that the public standard of morality is raised. Let us get
        good laws if we can; but there is only one way of really
        obtaining a nobler national existence, and that is by each
        of us individually learning to hate and detest the vile
        self-indulgence that covers the life of those who are the
        victims of it with shame and degradation. Self-control and
        respect for the rights of others are the only cure for the
        terrible national danger which threatens us. If men and
        women would learn never to take pleasure in what brings
        pain, shame, misery, and moral death to others, earth
        <a name="Page_205"
           id="Page_205"></a>would be turned into a heaven. It
           would be incredible if it were not true that for mere
           selfish indulgence thousands of men are willing to drag
           women down to what even these men themselves recognize
           as the lowest dregs of humanity. Where is their
           chivalry? Where is their common humanity? Some would say
           that such men do not possess either. For my part, I do
           not believe this. Let women thankfully acknowledge that,
           so far as other matters are concerned, they are
           constantly indebted to the chivalrous self-sacrifice of
           men. Chivalry is not dead; generous self-sacrifice is
           not dead; but in far too many cases, with regard to the
           all-important question of personal purity, they are
           sleeping. Our efforts must be directed to awakening
           them. We must try and make men realize the callous
           cruelty of all actions which lower the womanhood of even
           the poorest and most degraded of women."</p>
    </div>

    <p>And if we refuse, sunk in our own selfish interests and
    pleasures, and content that the daughters of the people should
    perish as long as our own are safe, then it will not be by an
    European coalition that the British Empire will perish, it will
    be by moral decay from within; in Blake's rough, strong
    words:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"The harlot's curse from street to
            street<br /></span> <span class="i0">Shall be old
            England's winding sheet."<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The British Empire, the great American Republic, the two
    greatest civilizing, order-spreading, Christianizing
    world-powers ever known, can only be saved by a solemn league
    and covenant of their women to bring back simplicity of life,
    plain living, high thinking, reverence for marriage laws,
    chivalrous respect for all womanhood, and a high standard of
    purity for men and women alike.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_206"
       id="Page_206"></a>Suffer me to lay before you three
       considerations, which will prove to you at once that this
       great moral question is more vital to our two nations than
       to any other, and that we are peculiarly vulnerable to the
       action of moral causes.</p>

    <p>Firstly, England, and in one sense England alone, is the
    mighty mother of nations. Three great nations have already
    sprung from her loins; a fourth in Africa is already in process
    of consolidation. From the narrow confines of our sea-girt
    island our people pour into all quarters of the globe; and if
    we suffer England to know corruption we send forth polluted
    waters into all lands. Your great Republic, on the other hand,
    is a mother of nations in another sense, since she receives
    into her mighty bosom vast numbers drawn from the suffering
    peoples of the old world, and gives them a mother's welcome.
    According as your civilization is high and pure, or low and
    corrupt, so will those naturalized citizens be. Decay with
    great empires, as with fish, sets in at the head; and the moral
    decadence of England and America will sensibly lower the moral
    standard of nearly one-third of the population of the
    world.<a name="FNanchor_39_39"
       id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39"
       class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The heart of the two nations is
       still sound. It is not too late. We are at least free from
       the continental system, by which the degradation of women is
       reduced to a systematized slavery, to meet what is
       <a name="Page_207"
       id="Page_207"></a>openly called a necessity of nature. The
       comparative purity of Englishmen and Americans is still a
       wonder, and often a derision to foreigners. Our women are a
       greater power than in any other country. We still start from
       a good vantage-ground.</p>

    <p>England, certainly through no merit of her own, has been
    called by the providence of God to lead in great moral causes.
    We led in the matter of slavery&mdash;the open sore of the
    world. We English and American women are now called to lead, in
    this its hidden sore, for the healing of the nations.</p>

    <p>Secondly, since you have elected to go beyond your own
    confines and have dependencies, and so take up the white man's
    burden of civilizing and Christianizing the world, your men as
    well as ours will be exposed to that dangerously lowering
    influence, contact with lower races and alien civilizations. An
    Englishman in India, if he be not a religious man, is apt to
    blind himself to wrongs done to womanhood, because those wrongs
    are often done to a pariah caste who are already set apart for
    infamy; though I have not yet heard of an Englishman possessing
    himself of slaves on the ground that they were slaves already
    to their native masters. Worse still, in savage or
    semi-civilized countries the native girl, far from feeling
    herself degraded, considers that she is raised by any union,
    however illicit, with a white man. It is the native men who are
    furious. Which of us in England did not feel an ache of shame
    in our <a name="Page_208"
       id="Page_208"></a>hearts over the plea of the Matabele to
       the white man: "You have taken our lands, and our
       hunting-grounds are gone. You have taken our herds, and we
       want for food. You have taken our young men, and made them
       slaves in your mines. You have taken our women <i>and done
       what you like with them</i>." How many of our native wars
       may not have had as their cause that last sentence in the
       plaint of the Matabele, a cause carefully concealed from the
       public eye? For God's sake, let mothers teach their sons
       that first rudiment in manly character, the recognition that
       the girls of a conquered race, or of a barbarian tribe
       inhabiting one of our spheres of influence, from the very
       fact that they are a conquered race, or, if not conquered,
       hopelessly and piteously in our power, are <i>ipso facto</i>
       a most sacred trust to us, which it is both unmanly and
       bestial to violate. Especially I would plead with mothers to
       send us pure men for our army&mdash;officers who will set
       their men a high example of chivalry towards the weakest
       native woman, and who will so influence them by example and
       personal influence that they may look upon voluntarily
       disabling themselves from active service, while still taking
       the government pay, as unmanly and unsoldierly. Give us men
       who can say with a non-commissioned officer writing home to
       one of our White Cross secretaries: "I have been out in
       India now eleven years and have never had a day's illness;
       and I think the whole secret of my good health
       <a name="Page_209"
       id="Page_209"></a>is total abstinence from all that
       intoxicates, and that I honor all women as I honor my mother
       or any of my sisters."</p>

    <p>Thirdly, the hardest thing on earth is not to slay a sin,
    but to get it buried; and the hardest of all sins to get under
    ground is the sin of impurity. It is largely due to the low
    standard of purity among men that we owe the almost insoluble
    problem presented by the existence of the large Eurasian
    population in India, and of the half-caste generally.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"The universal unanimity of the popular verdict on the
        half-caste is remarkable," says Olive Schreiner in some
        powerful articles published in <i>Blackwood</i> on the
        problems presented by our Colonial Empire. "The half-caste,
        it is asserted in every country where he is known, whether
        it be in America, Asia, or Africa, and whether his
        ancestors be English and negroid Spanish and Indian, or
        Boer and Hottentot,&mdash;the self-caste is by nature
        anti-social. It is always asserted that he possesses the
        vices of both parent races and the virtues of neither: that
        he is born especially with a tendency to be a liar,
        cowardly, licentious, and without self-respect."</p>
    </div>

    <p>Olive Schreiner herself is the first to admit that there are
    exceptions. She says:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"The fact that amongst the most despised class of our
        laboring half-castes we have all met individuals, not only
        of the highest integrity, but of rare moral beauty and of
        heroic and fully developed social feelings, does not impugn
        the theory of his unfortunate position. If you should sow
        human seed inside the door of hell, some of it would yet
        come up white lilies. But as a rule the popular verdict on
        the half-caste is not overdrawn."</p>
    </div>

    <p><a name="Page_210"
       id="Page_210"></a>I strongly agree with Mrs. Schreiner that
       this lamentable result is not due solely, or even chiefly,
       to the admixture of races, but far more to the circumstances
       in which he has been born and bred. He has originated in
       almost all cases, not from the union of average individuals
       of the two races uniting under average conditions, but as
       the result of a sexual union between the most helpless and
       enslaved females of the dark race and the most recklessly
       dominant males of the white. "He enters a world in which
       there was no place prepared for him." His father was about
       as sensible of his parental obligations towards him as a
       toad towards its spawn in the next ditch. To him he "was a
       broken wineglass from last night's feast." "Often without a
       family, always without a nation or race, without education
       or moral training, and despised by the society in which he
       was born," is it any wonder that the half-caste is the curse
       of the community in which he is found;&mdash;one of those
       whips, as Shakespeare reminds us, that "heaven makes out of
       our pleasant vices" to "scourge" us into some sense of their
       seriousness?</p>

    <p>If you would not incur that curse, that insoluble problem of
    the half-caste, then in both your civil and military services
    send out men of clean hearts and lives into your dependencies,
    Alas! in your great military camps during your Spanish war a
    moral laxity was allowed, which, had it been attempted in
    the<a name="Page_211"
       id="Page_211"></a> Egyptian campaign, Lord Kitchener would
       have stamped out with a divine fury. I had it from an
       eyewitness, but the details are wholly unfit for
       publication.</p>

    <p>I do not hold with our "little Englanders" that the
    possession of an empire is a disaster; on the contrary, I hold
    that it constitutes a splendid school for the formation of
    strong character,&mdash;of men who are the very salt of the
    earth,&mdash;and that the sense of a great mission to be
    fulfilled tends to give a nobility of soul to the whole nation;
    while even the wars it may involve prove the vultures of God
    swooping down on the hidden social rottennesses which in
    prolonged peace may breed unnoticed and unreproved. We have
    never forgotten the bitter lessons of the Crimean war which
    laid bare our miserable incompetence in organizing, and the
    moral rottenness of our English firms that could supply our
    soldiers with paper-soled boots and bayonets that bent at a
    thrust, when the very life of our brave fellows depended on
    their being well armed and well shod.</p>

    <p>America will never forget the sufferings of her wounded in
    the Spanish war, sufferings caused by the like dishonesty in
    the goods supplied and the like criminal incompetency which
    failed to provide them even with necessaries.</p>

    <p>But I do say that an empire presents many difficult
    problems, and that the men who accept its responsibilities need
    a sound head, clean hands, and above all a pure heart.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_212"
       id="Page_212"></a>Let me in conclusion relate an incident
       which happened in the wreck of the <i>Warren Hastings</i>,
       to which I have already alluded,&mdash;an incident which I
       can never tell without a breaking voice and eyes full of
       tears. In that awful night of storm and darkness and iminent
       shipwreck, the officer in command, after ordering his men
       below to lighten the crowded deck, stationed two of his men
       at a narrow gangway through which he feared an ugly rush for
       life might be made, while the women and children were being
       embarked, bidding them on no account to leave their post
       till he gave them the word of command. At length the women
       and the sick had all been saved in the boats. This done, and
       not till then, the men had saved themselves, some by boats,
       some by life preservers; and last of all the captain and
       officer in command were proceeding to leave the fast
       foundering ship, when the latter heard a voice close to him,
       saying, "Colonel, may we leave now?" It was the voice of one
       of his two sentinels. In the stress and strain of the awful
       scenes of that night he had for the moment forgotten that he
       had ordered them not to leave their post until he gave the
       word of command. And he said that <i>the water was almost up
       to their lips!</i></p>

    <p>Oh ye mothers of America and of our great Empire! send us
    such men as these,&mdash;men who will mount guard over women
    and children in all lands, and see, as far as in them lies,
    that they do not make shipwreck of <a name="Page_213"
       id="Page_213"></a>what is dearer than life;&mdash;men who,
       even with the bitter waters of temptation up to their own
       lips, will still hold their post and see that no man, to
       save himself, drives them down into that dread sea of
       perdition which never gives up its dead.</p>

    <p>Then East, West, North, South, the American flag will
    witness in the face of all nations to the true manhood that
    steers its course by no earth-born fires of passion and selfish
    lust, but by the eternal stars, the heavenly lights of God, and
    mother, and duty, and home.</p>

    <p>East, West, North, South, by its side our flag, twice scored
    with the White Cross, will float wide in the face of all
    nations the Englishman's faith, reverence for womanhood,
    self-giving manhood, and the pure heart that sees God.</p>

    <p>There remains yet one other way in which I earnestly desire
    to help you if I can. I would fain afford you some light on
    this difficult problem and give you a spring of hope within by
    enabling you to see what it is working out in the world
    without. Some, I know, do not need this help. Some wholesome
    souls seem to gaze on all evil with sun-dazzled eyes&mdash;eyes
    that see Him in whom they walk, and not it, and in His light
    they see light. They are the "naturally Christian" souls who
    lead melodious days amid all the jars and discords of the world
    around them. Others there are who seem to look upon these great
    social evils as especially provided to afford a sphere for
    their beneficent activities; and who if, by some sudden rise in
    public opinion, some passionate sense of the wrong done to
    women, the degraded class should almost cease
    <a name="Page_215"
       id="Page_215"></a>to exist, would in their heart of hearts
       secretly regret so many empty beds in their little Rescue
       Home and the possibility that it might have to be shut up,
       when "the girls did turn out so well." Others, again, there
       are who never trouble their heads or hearts about the misery
       and sin of the world, or any social problem, however dark,
       as long as their own house is comfortable, their own bed
       soft, and their own children healthy and well cared for,
       never dreaming how those social evils may press upon those
       children in their after-life. These are in no need of this
       kind of help. But there are many thoughtful mothers,
       possibly an increasing number with the increase of knowledge
       that is coming to all women, from whose heart there is going
       up a bitter cry, "Why, oh why is all this evil permitted?"
       Why is there this nameless moral difficulty at the very
       heart of our life which our whole soul revolts from
       contemplating? Why has Nature made these passions so strong
       that she seems wholly regardless of all considerations of
       morality?<a name="FNanchor_41_41"
       id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41"
       class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

    <p>Some there are who feel that all infidel books are mere
    curl-paper in comparison with the terrible facts
    <a name="Page_216"
       id="Page_216"></a>of life, some who are in danger of having
       all faith crushed out of them&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"Beneath the weary and the heavy
            weight<br /></span> <span class="i0">Of all this
            unintelligible world."<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It is these who need, like myself, as a first step to strong
    action, to see something of what God is working out by the evil
    and suffering of the world, to see it as a part of a vast
    redemptive whole, not as a great exception in our life, but
    working under the same law by which, in the words of the
    ancient collect, "things which are cast down are being raised
    up, and things which had grown old are being made new, and all
    things are returning to perfection through Him from whom they
    had their origin."</p>

    <p>Now, do not think that I am going to indulge in a
    dissertation on the origin of evil or why the world is so full
    of sin and misery. This is insoluble. You cannot solve a
    problem which has only one term. Your unknown quantity must
    have some known factor or factors related to it, or you cannot
    resolve it into the known. In this great claim of cause and
    effect, where all things are related and interdependent, you
    can only know a related thing through its relations. Try to
    account for a bit of chalk, for instance, and consider all you
    must know in order to enable you to do so. To account for its
    weight you must know something about the motion of the whole
    planetary system and the law of gravity <a name="Page_217"
       id="Page_217"></a>that controls that system; to account for
       the weather-stains upon it, you must know something about
       chemical reaction; to account for its being chalk and not
       flint, you must know something of the geological ages of the
       earth, and how it comes to be built up of little sea-shells;
       to account for its hardness, you must know something of the
       intricacies of molecular physics. All this you must know to
       account for a mere bit of chalk. How, then, can we expect to
       understand the problem of the world when we know absolutely
       nothing of its relations with the great moral and spiritual
       whole to which it belongs, and without the knowledge of
       which it must for ever remain an insoluble problem,
       presenting one term only, an enigma of which we do not
       possess the key?</p>

    <p>But though we cannot understand the origin of evil and why
    the world is as it is, we can understand something of the
    processes which are at work for good or ill. We can in a
    measure trace whether these processes are making slowly but
    surely for righteousness, or whether all the sin and the
    suffering are aimless and purposeless, a voice that cries
    "believe no more,"</p>

    thing that might-shut us up to pessimism and to "a philosophy
    only just above suicide mark," would <a name="Page_218"
       id="Page_218"></a>be not the presence but the absence of
       these great world evils. If this world presented a
       dead-level of comfortable selfishness that on the whole
       answered fairly well all round, an economy of petty
       self-interests in stable equilibrium, a world generally
       wrong, but working out no evil in particular to set it
       right, a society in which every man was for himself, and not
       the devil, as at present, but God for us all&mdash;then
       indeed we might despair. But who can contemplate humanity as
       it is, that broken stair of the Divinity, whose top is in
       the unapproachable light of heaven and whose lowest step
       rests not on earth but in hell, without feeling that it is
       destined for an infinite progress, destined for the
       ascending feet of angels? Who that gazes on this world, with
       its infinite depths of pain, its heavy weight of evil, its
       abysmal falls, its stupendous pressures of wrong and misery,
       but feels that here, if anywhere, we are in the presence of
       kinetic energies, of immense moral and spiritual forces,
       capable of raising the whole of fallen humanity to the
       heights of the Divine. For let us remember that in the moral
       and spiritual world, as well as in the physical, no fall but
       carries with it the force that can be converted into a rise;
       no dread resistance of wrong to the right but creates an
       accumulated force which once let loose can transform an
       empire; no weight of evil but, in pulling it down, can be
       made to raise the whole bent of our life.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_219"
       id="Page_219"></a>He is "no finite and finished clod."
       Progress, as Browning says, is his distinctive mark, and
       these deep evils are the gigantic steps by which he rises as
       he treads them under foot. Once recognize the fact that he
       is a fallen being&mdash;and by that I mean no theological
       dogma, but a truth of life, which, whatever our creed may
       be, must stare us in the face&mdash;the fact that he is a
       being knowing good but choosing evil, capable of an ideal
       but habitually falling below it, no mere automaton, but
       possessed of a spiritual will and an accusing
       conscience&mdash;I ask how else can he be educated, in the
       true sense of the word, and raised from death unto life
       except by being made to educe his own results and work out
       his evil premiss to the bitter end, till he is forced to go
       back upon himself, and recognize the right principle which
       he has violated? The very law of his being, of every being
       who is being raised from death unto life, is, that he can
       only know life through death, only grasp good by grappling
       with evil, only gain knowledge by knowing ignorance; his
       highest must be sown in weakness before it can be raised in
       power, must be sown in dishonor before it can be raised in
       glory.</p>

    <p>Look back over the past and see if it is not in conflict
    with these great world evils, themselves the results of man's
    moral blindness and sin, that we have worked out the true
    principles of our life, the higher possibilities of our
    humanity.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_220"
       id="Page_220"></a>Take the most elementary case first, man's
       disobedience to the physical laws under which he must live
       to have a sound mind in a sound body. Man in his primitive
       stages is emphatically not a clean animal. On the contrary,
       he is a very dirty one. He has none of the cat's dainty
       neatness and cleanliness, none of her instinctive
       recognition of the deodorizing and purifying power of the
       earth, that makes the foulest thing once buried spring up in
       fresh grass and fragrant flowers. He has nothing of the
       imperative impulse of the little ant which he treads under
       his lordly feet to shampoo his brother, let alone himself.
       It has needed the discipline and the suffering of the ages
       to evolve that great banner of progress, the clean shirt.
       From what great world pestilences has he not had to suffer
       as the consequences of his own uncleanliness! Cholera has
       been rightly called the beneficent sanitary inspector of the
       world. With what foul diseases, the very details of which
       would sicken, has he not had to be scourged withal to get
       him to recognize and obey the one Divine injunction, "Wash
       and be clean"! Truly his knowledge and recognition of
       sanitary law, his "physical righteousness," has had to be
       sown in the weakness and corruption of disease before it
       could be raised to the power of a recognized law of life,
       insuring that cleanliness which is next to godliness.</p>

    <p>Again, take the great principle of national
    freedom,&mdash;that a nation has a right to govern its own
    destinies.<a name="Page_221"
       id="Page_221"></a> With what world tyrannies and
       oppressions, the outcome of man's selfish lust of power and
       wealth, have not the peoples had to fight and struggle in
       order at length to win and get recognized that principle of
       freedom without which a nation can be neither strong nor
       holy, neither a citadel nor a temple! The Iron Duke used to
       say, "There is but one thing worse than a battle gained, and
       that is a battle lost." Yet what battles lost and what
       battles gained, with all their sickening sights and
       sounds&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span class="i0">"Oaths, insults, filth, and monstrous
            blasphemies,<br /></span> <span class="i0">Sweat,

            <span class="i0">In that close mist, and cryings for

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>what bloody conflicts through the long ages have not had to
    be fought out to gain this freedom! Truly we might apostrophize
    Freedom in the words of the Hebrew prophet: "Who is this that
    cometh with her garments dyed in blood?" Through what long
    centuries did not what Sir John Seeley called the "mechanical
    theory of government" survive, the theory which recognized no
    vital bond of blood and historical tradition between a people
    and its government, but looked upon nations as royal appanages,
    to be banded about with royal alliances and passed under an
    alien sway without consent on its own part! Did it not require
    a Napoleon to work out this false premiss to its bitter end,
    drenching Europe in blood to gratify his own greed of power,
    and <a name="Page_222"
       id="Page_222"></a>reducing nation after nation to his alien
       and despotic rule, till it was felt to be intolerable, and
       with a convulsive struggle Europe threw off the yoke? Truly
       a struggle which was the birth-throes of national sentiment
       and the recognition that the tie between the governed and
       the governing must be an organic one, a tie of blood from
       within, not a force from without&mdash;in one word, the
       recognition of the great principle of national freedom
       which, when the nation is sufficiently developed and
       self-disciplined to be fit for it, is the great mother of
       progress. Sown in the corruption of those mangled and
       decaying corpses on many an awful battle-field, freedom is
       raised to the glory of an incorruptible truth of national
       life.</p>

    <p>Once again, was it not in his age-long conflict with the
    great world evil of slavery that man worked out the true nature
    of a moral personality? Man started at the outset with the evil
    premiss of the right of the strong to possess himself of the
    weak and the conquered, and enslave him for his own use,
    shunting the toil and burden of life upon his bowed shoulders.
    Through long ages he had to work out this wrong premiss in
    disaster to empires through the laziness and worthlessness of
    their ruling classes engendered by slave labor, in the dumb
    suffering and bitter wrongs of millions of enslaved men and
    women. Through centuries the Church protested against these
    wrongs in vain, since the evil root, in the face of all
    protests, will <a name="Page_223"
       id="Page_223"></a>go on bearing the evil fruit. England,
       herself the mother of free peoples, was stained with the
       guilt of being one of the first to originate the worst form
       of slavery that the world has ever seen, the African
       slave-trade, her great Queen Elizabeth not scorning to
       enrich her royal coffers out of the profits of slave-raiding
       expeditions conducted by her sea-captains. It needed the
       horrors of this latest development of the principle of
       slavery, the horrors of the middle passage, of whole regions
       of Africa decimated to supply the slave market, of mothers
       torn from their children, or, worse still, compelled to bear
       them to their slave masters, only to see them in their turn
       sold to some far-off station; of the degradation of men and
       women brought up in heathen ignorance lest they should use
       their knowledge to rebel&mdash;it needed all this weight of
       evil and disaster at last to rouse the conscience of Europe
       to recognize that slavery was wrong in itself and to cast
       out the evil premiss on which it rested. By the mere force
       of moral revulsion in England, by the throes of a great
       civil war engendered by slavery in America, at last the true
       nature of a moral personality got itself
       recognized,&mdash;the inviolability of personal
       responsibility, the sanctity of the individual, the
       sacredness of freedom,&mdash;those great principles on which
       the whole of our public and political life are founded. And
       I make bold to say that these principles were gained as a
       heritage for all time, not by the preaching of abstract
       <a name="Page_224"
       id="Page_224"></a>justice, not by any consideration of the
       moral beauty of liberty, but mainly by a remorseful passion
       over the wrongs and the degradation of the slave. These
       great principles were sown in weakness and dishonor, to be
       raised in honor and in the power of an endless life.</p>

    <p>When, therefore, the Church of the living God awakes, as she
    is just beginning to do, and closes in a life and death
    struggle with this far deeper and more pervasive evil of the
    degradation of women and children, which she has too long
    accepted as a melancholy necessity of human nature, may we not
    find in the course of that conflict that wholly new powers and
    new principles are being evolved, and that the apparent
    impossibilities of our nature are only its divine possibilities
    in disguise? May we not work out the true principles, not now
    of our public and political life, but of the home, of the
    family, of personal conduct and character&mdash;all those great
    moral bases on which the whole social structure rests for its
    stability? Granted that this is the deepest and strongest of
    all our world evils, that which is the most firmly based on the
    original forces of our nature, and of that part of our nature
    which has shown the deepest disorder&mdash;does not all this
    point to some great issue? That which has been sown in such
    deep dishonor, will it not be raised in some glory that
    excelleth?</p>

    <p>If God has suffered mighty empires and whole kingdoms to be
    wrecked on this one evil; if He has made <a name="Page_225"
       id="Page_225"></a>it throughout the Old Scriptures the
       symbol of departure from Himself, and closely associated
       monogamic love with monotheistic worship, teaching us by the
       history of all ancient idolatries that the race which is
       impure spawns unclean idols and Phrygian rites; if Nature
       attaches such preciousness to purity in man that the
       statistics of insurance offices value a young man's life at
       twenty-five, the very prime of well-regulated manhood, at
       exactly one-half of what it is worth at fourteen, owing, Dr.
       Carpenter does not hesitate to say, to the indulgence of the
       passions of youth; if the tender Father, "who sits by the
       death-bed of the little sparrow," has not thought it too
       great a price to pay that countless women and children
       should be sunk to hell without a chance in this life, in a
       degradation that has no name, but which, in its very depth,
       measures the height of the sanctity of womanhood; do we
       think that all these stupendous issues are for no end and to
       work out no purpose? Do we not feel at once that we stand
       here at the very centre of the mighty forces that are
       moulding men to nobler shape and higher use?</p>

    <p>Here, at least, is a force, if we will only use it, so
    weighted with public disaster, with national decay, with
    private misery, that it insists on making itself felt if there
    be a spark of life left and the nation has not become mere dead
    carcase for the vultures of God's judgments to prey upon. Here
    alone is a power strong enough to compel us to simplify our
    life and restore its old divine <a name="Page_226"
       id="Page_226"></a>order of marriage and hard work, of "plain
       living and high thinking," which luxury and self-ease are
       fast undermining. Here, in the slain of the daughters of our
       people, is a stinging wrong that will goad us into seeing
       that the people are so housed that a human life is possible
       to them. Here, if anywhere, is a passion of conscience, and
       pity, and duty, and interest combined, strong enough, a
       heaped-up weight of evil heavy enough, to raise us to a
       self-giving manhood and a self-reverencing womanhood.</p>

    <p>And from this secret place of thunder is not God now calling
    His chosen ones to come forward and be fellow-workers with Him?
    And when that call is obeyed, when, to summarize what I have
    already said, the wrongs and degradation of women and hapless
    children take hold of men, as, thank God, they are beginning to
    take hold, with a remorseful passion, that passion for the
    weak, the wronged, and the defenceless, which surely is the
    divine in flower in a human soul; when women rise up in a wild
    revolt against</p>

    <p>when the Christian Church at length hears the persistent
    interrogation of her Lord, "Seest thou this woman?" and makes
    answer, "Yea, Lord, I see that she is young, and poor, and
    outcast, and degraded," and <a name="Page_227"
       id="Page_227"></a>speaks to young men with something of the
       passion of the true Man&mdash;"It were better for you that a
       millstone were hanged about your neck and you cast into the
       depths of the sea, than that you should cause one of these
       little ones to stumble"; when the fact that a foolish, giddy
       girl's feet have slipped and fallen is no longer the signal
       for every man to look upon her as fair game, and to trample
       her deeper into the mire, but the signal to every man
       calling himself a man to hasten to her side, to raise her up
       again and restore her to her lost womanhood; when boys are
       taught from their earliest years that if they would have a
       clear brain, a firm nerve, and a strong muscle, they must be
       pure, and purity is looked upon as manly, at least, as much
       as truth and courage; when women are no longer so lost to
       the dignity of their own womanhood as to make companions of
       the very men who insult and degrade it; when the woman
       requires the man to come to her in holy marriage in the
       glory of his unfallen manhood, as he requires her to come to
       him in the beauty of her spotless maidenhood; then, when
       these things begin to be, will not God's order slowly evolve
       itself out of our disorder, and the man will become the head
       of the woman, to guard her from all that makes her unfit to
       be the mother of the race, and the woman will be the heart
       of the man, to inspire him with all noble purpose? As we
       stand by this great world-sepulchre of corruption our
       unbelieving heart can only exclaim: "It <a name="Page_228"
       id="Page_228"></a>stinketh." But the Christ meets us with
       the words, "Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldst
       believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God?" That which has
       been sown in human weakness must be raised in divine power;
       that which has been sown in deep dishonor must be raised in
       glory. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, even
       the self-giving manhood of Him who is the Prince of Passion
       and the Lord of Love, the manhood lifted into God.</p>

    <h2><a name="CONCLUSION"
       id="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>

    <p>And it is this great upward movement, lifting man to a
    higher level, which is given into the hands of us women,
    touching, as it does, all the great trusts of our womanhood.
    What are we women going to do in the face of such vast issues
    for good or evil?</p>

    <p>Undoubtedly we stand at the parting of the ways. In England
    undoubtedly the old high traditions of English society have, at
    least in what is called the "Upper Ten," been lowered and
    vulgarized. Our literature is no longer as clean and wholesome
    as it was. The greater freedom that women enjoy has not always
    been put to high uses. And all around us in both countries the
    old order is changing, and the new order is not yet born. Old
    positions are becoming untenable, with the higher position and
    culture of women. It is becoming an impossibility for
    intelligent women with a knowledge of physiology and an added
    sense of their own dignity to accept the lower moral standard
    for men, which exposes them to the risk of exchanging monogamy
    for a peculiarly vile polygamy&mdash;polygamy with its
    sensuality, but without its duties&mdash;bringing physical
    risks to their children and the terrible likelihood of an
    inherited moral taint to their sons. It is an
    <a name="Page_230"
       id="Page_230"></a>impossibility, now that mothers know, that
       they should remain indifferent as to what sort of manhood
       they send out into the world&mdash;the so-called manhood
       that either makes and maintains the miserable sinner of our
       streets or is content to give a tainted name to the mother
       of his child, or the true manhood lifted into God, whose
       marriage is the type of the eternal union of God and the
       soul, of Christ and the Church, and whose fatherhood claims
       kinship with the Father of lights. It is impossible for
       women who are agitating for the enfranchisement of their sex
       to accept as a necessary class in the midst of a
       democratical society a class of citizens who, in Dr.
       Welldon's<a name="FNanchor_42_42"
       id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42"
       class="fnanchor">[42]</a> words, addressed to the University
       of Cambridge, "have lost once for all time the rights of
       citizenship&mdash;who are nobody's wives, nobody's sisters,
       nobody's friends, who live a living death in the world of
       men. There are one hundred and fifty thousand such
       citizens,&mdash;perhaps far more, in England and
       Wales&mdash;<i>and all are women</i>."</p>

    <p>These old positions are simply impossible, each a moral
    <i>reductio ad absurdam</i>. We must institute a new and higher
    order. To do so we women must unite in a great silent movement,
    a temple slowly rising up beneath our hands without sound of
    axe or hammer. It will not make itself heard on platforms; its
    cry will not be heard in our streets. It will go on beneath the
    surface of our life, probably unheeded and unnoticed of
    <a name="Page_231"
       id="Page_231"></a>men. Women must educate women; those who
       know must teach those who are in ignorance. Let mothers who
       have been roused to the greatness of the issues at stake
       take as their field of labor the young mothers whom they may
       know&mdash;possibly their own married daughters or nieces,
       possibly those who are only bound to them by ties of
       friendship. Use this book, if you will. If there are things
       in it which you don't approve of&mdash;and oh, how much of
       the divine patience of our Lord do we need with one another
       in dealing with this difficult question&mdash;cut out those
       pages, erase that passage, but do not deny those young
       mothers the necessary knowledge to guard the nursery or save
       their boys at school. And then try and follow it up by
       quietly talking over the difficulties and the best method of
       encountering them. Let us deny ourselves in order to give to
       associations or institutions for the elevation of women, as
       well as to that excellent society for men, the White Cross,
       which is spreading its purifying work through both
       countries.<a name="FNanchor_43_43"
       id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43"
       class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Let us do what we can to help in
       <a name="Page_232"
       id="Page_232"></a>organizing women's labor, so that a living
       wage may be secured and no woman be driven by starvation
       into selling herself for a morsel of bread. Let us endeavor
       to secure the franchise that we may have the power of
       legislating for the protection of women on the one point on
       which we stand in sharp opposition to all but good men;
       especially such measures as raising the age of consent, so
       deplorably low in some of your States, that your children
       are almost without legal protection; resisting State
       regulation of vice in the army; cleansing the streets by an
       Act pressing equally on men and women, and many others which
       will suggest themselves to you. But let us, at the same
       time, clearly recognize that the remedy must lie deeper than
       any external agency&mdash;must be as deep as life itself,
       and must be worked out in the silence of our own hearts and
       of our own homes. We must restore the law of God, quietly
       but firmly insisting on the equal moral standard for men and
       women alike; and we must maintain the sanctity and
       permanence of the marriage bond as ordained by Christ
       himself.</p>

    <p>I say again I do not think, I simply <i>know</i>, by my own
    experience, that men will rise to any standard which women
    choose to set them. Ruskin's noble words are the simple
    truth:</p>

    <p><a name="Page_233"
       id="Page_233"></a></p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"Their whole course and character are in your hands;
        what you would have them be they shall be, if you not only
        desire to have them so, but deserve to have them so, for
        they are but mirrors in which you will see yourselves
        imaged.... You fancy, perhaps, as you have been told so
        often, that a wife's rule should only be over her husband's
        house, not over his mind. Ah no! the true rule is just the
        reverse of that: a true wife, in her husband's house, is
        his servant; it is in his heart that she is queen. Whatever
        of best he can conceive, it is her part to be; whatever of
        highest he can hope, it is hers to promise. All that is
        dark in him she must purge into purity; all that is failing
        in him she must strengthen into truth; from her, through
        all the world's clamor, he must win his praise; in her,
        through all the world's warfare, he must find his
        peace."</p>
    </div>

    <p>Last, but not least, we must set ourselves to make our lives
    simpler and plainer, and oppose the ever-increasing luxury and
    love of pleasure, with its sure and certain result, a relaxed
    moral fibre, which, to a race called to such high destinies and
    difficult tasks as our Anglo-Saxon race, is simply fatal. It
    can, and it must be done. As Philip Hammerton remarks:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"It is entirely within the power of public opinion to
        relieve the world from the weariness of this burthen of
        expensive living; it has actually been done to a great
        extent with regard to the costliness of funerals, a matter
        in which public opinion has always been very authoritative.
        If it will now permit a man to be buried simply when he is
        dead, why cannot it allow him to exist simply whilst he is
        living?"</p>
    </div>

    <p>To lessen the expense of dress, which has risen twenty per
    cent, within the last thirty years; to restore amusements to
    their proper place, as recreation after hard work for the good
    of others; to resist the ever-<a name="Page_234"
       id="Page_234"></a>increasing restlessness of our day,
       leading to such constant absences from home as seriously to
       threaten all steady work for the amelioration of the
       stay-at-home classes, and use up the funds which are needed
       for that work; to keep a simple table, so that the future
       Sir Andrew Clark may no longer have to say that more than
       half of our diseases come from over-eating; to resist the
       vulgar tendency to compete with our richer or more
       fashionable neighbors in their style of living&mdash;surely
       these sacrifices are not beyond us, to attain a great end,
       both for ourselves and our empire. If indeed we think we can
       meet this evil without making sacrifices amounting to a
       silent revolution in our life; if we think, as I have
       sometimes thought some women do think, that we can quench
       this pit of perdition in our midst by, as it were, emptying
       our scent-bottles upon it,&mdash;shedding a few empty tears,
       heaving a few sentimental sighs: "It is very sad! of course
       I can't do anything, but I am sure I wish all success to
       your noble work"&mdash;possibly even giving a very little
       money, say a guinea a year, to a penitentiary&mdash;all I
       can say is, <i>God is not mocked</i>. I know but one thing
       in heaven or earth that will quench it, and that is
       life-blood. Sometimes I have asked in anguish of spirit:
       "Will women give it?" I believe they will. But, whether we
       give it or not, what Matthew Arnold called "the noblest of
       religious utterances" holds good here: "Without shedding of
       blood there is no remission of this sin."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_235"
       id="Page_235"></a>And it is because I know that mothers will
       spend their heart's blood in saving their sons, and because
       I believe that women, with their new-born position and
       dignity, will not go on accepting as a matter of course that
       their womanhood should be fashioned like the Egyptian
       sphinx, half pure woman, crowned with intellectual and moral
       beauty, dowered with the homage of men; and half unclean
       beast of prey, seeking whom it may slay, outcast and
       abandoned and forced to snare or starve&mdash;it is because
       of this, my rooted faith in women, that I have hope.</p>

    <p>As long ago as 1880 Professor Max Müller, ever anxious for
    the interests of his Indian fellow-subjects, when Mr. Malabari
    came to ask him how he could rouse English public opinion with
    regard to the injuries inflicted on young girls by Hindu
    child-marriages, answered him at once, "Write a short pamphlet
    and send it to the women of England. They begin to be a power,
    and they have one splendid quality, they are never
    beaten."<a name="FNanchor_44_44"
       id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44"
       class="fnanchor">[44]</a> And if this can be said of English
       women, still more may it be said of the women of
       America.</p>

    <p>But, further, to strengthen us in this splendid quality,
    have we sufficiently recognized the new moral forces that are
    coming into the world? Have our eyes been opened to see "the
    horses and chariots of fire" which <a name="Page_236"
       id="Page_236"></a>are silently taking up their position
       around us, to guard us and fight for us, that we may not be
       beaten; the deepened sense of moral obligation, the added
       power of conscience, the altogether new altruistic sense
       which makes the misery and degradation of others cling to us
       like a garment we cannot shake off, a sense of others' woes
       for which we have had to invent a new word? Lord
       Shaftesbury's legislation does not date so very far back;
       and yet when his Bill for delivering women and children from
       working in our mines was hanging in the balance, and the
       loss of a single vote might wreck it&mdash;women, be it
       remembered, who were working naked to the waist in the
       coal-mines, and little children of eight or nine who were
       carrying half a sack of coals twelve times a day the height
       of St. Paul's Cathedral&mdash;the Archbishop of Canterbury
       and the Bishop of London left the House of Lords without
       voting, as the subject did not interest them; while in the
       lower House Bright and Gladstone both voted against the
       Bill, Gladstone being the only member who, when the Bill was
       passed by a bare majority, endeavored to delay its coming
       into operation! I ask, Would such a state of things be
       possible in these days? Am I not right in saying that new
       moral forces and sensibilities have been born within us
       which make such a state of things not only impossible, but
       simply incomprehensible?</p>

    <p>Why then should we despair? What! Has God <a name="Page_237"
       id="Page_237"></a>built up His everlasting marble of broken
       shells, and will He not build up his temple of the future
       out of these broken efforts of ours? Has He made His pure
       and splendid diamond out of mere soot, and shall we refuse
       to see in the blackest and foulest moral problem the
       possibilities of the diamond, of a higher life worked out in
       the process of its solution, reflecting His light and His
       love? Has He made His precious sapphire of the mere mud that
       we tread under our feet, and, when we insist on our little
       sisters' being no longer trodden like mud "under foot of
       vicious men," may they not in the course of their redemption
       bring an added hue of heaven to our life, an added purity to
       home and family, and behold, instead of the old mud, a
       sapphire throne, and above it the likeness as of a divine
       man?<a name="FNanchor_45_45"
       id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45"
       class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

    <p>But to those who still hang back with a feeling of almost
    angry repulsion from the whole subject which makes them refuse
    even to face the perils and temptations of their own boys, I
    would address no hard words, remembering but too well the
    terrible struggle it cost me to make this my life work. Only I
    would remind them of that greatest act in all history, by which
    the world was redeemed. The Cross to us is so associated with
    the adoration of the ages, so glorified by art, and music, and
    lofty thought, that we have ceased to realize what it was in
    actual fact such as no painter has ever <a name="Page_238"
       id="Page_238"></a>dared to portray it; the Cross, not
       elevated as in sacred pictures, but huddled up with the
       jeering crowd; the Cross with its ribald blasphemies, its
       shameful nakedness, its coarse mockeries, its brutal
       long-drawn torture. Do you think it cost the women of that
       day nothing to bear all this on their tender hearts? Yet
       what was it that made men draw nearer and nearer, till the
       women who at first "stood afar off, beholding these things,"
       we are told, at last "stood by the cross of Jesus"; and,
       when all men forsook Him and fled, placed themselves heart
       to heart with the Divine Love bearing the sins of the world
       and casting them into the abysmal depths of its own being,
       deeper even than the depths of man's sin? What was it but
       their faithfulness to the Highest that they had known which
       made them endure the Cross, despising the shame?</p>

    <p>And now, when at the end of the ages He once again calls us
    women to stand heart to heart with Him in a great redemptive
    purpose, shall we hang back? Shall we not rather obey the
    Divine call, enduring the Cross, despising the shame, and, like
    those women of old, winning for ourselves, by faithfulness unto
    death, the joy of being made the messengers of a higher and
    risen life to the world?</p>

    <p>God grant that the power of the Holy Ghost may overshadow us
    and enable us to make answer with her whom all generations have
    called blessed: "Behold the hand-maiden of the Lord!"</p>

            order of knighthood to the prayers and support of
            women. It is bravely fighting our battle for us and
            doing the public work among men. As it attacks what is
            especially the sin of the moneyed classes, it is
            unpopular, men resenting its interference with what
            they call their private life, and it is always in peril
            for want of funds. The White Cross league admits women
            associates for intercessory prayer&mdash;and what
            mother will not be thankful for that?&mdash;for any
            work where women's aid is needed, and for raising funds
            for what is so emphatically our own cause. I would
            earnestly suggest to women who have incomes of their
            own that they should leave the White Cross a small
            legacy, so as to place it on a firmer basis. I hope
            myself to leave the English branch £2000.</p>

    <h2><a name="APPENDIX"
       id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX</h2>

    <p>In Mr. Edward Thring's address to the Church Congress at
    Carlisle in 1841, he said:</p>

    <p>"Curiosity, ignorance, and lies form a very hot-bed of
    impurity. We pay heavily for our civilized habits in false
    shame and the mystery in which sex is wrapped.</p>

    <p>"I confess that for curiosity I have no remedy to propose.
    Ignorance and lies are on a different footing. I suppose
    everyone is acquainted with some of the current lies about the
    impossibility of being pure. The only answer to this is a flat
    denial from experience. I know it is possible, and, when once
    attained, easy. The means, under God, in my own case, was a
    letter from my father. A quiet, simple statement of the
    sinfulness of the sin and a few of the plain texts from St.
    Paul saved me. A film fell from my eyes at my father's letter.
    My first statement is that all fathers ought to write such a
    letter to their sons. It is not difficult if done in a
    common-sense way. Following out this plan at Uppingham in the
    morning Bible lessons, I have always spoken as occasion arose
    with perfect plainness on lust and its devil-worship,
    particularly noting its deadly effect on human life and its
    early and dishonored graves. Ignorance is deadly, because
    perfect ignorance in a boy is impossible. I consider the
    half-ignorance so deadly that once a year, at the time of
    confirmation, I speak openly to the whole school, divided into
    three different sets. First I take the confirmees, then the
    communicants and older boys, then the younger boys, on three
    following nights after evening prayers. The first two sets I
    speak very plainly to, the last only warn against all indecency
    in thought, word, or deed, whether alone or with companions.
    Thus no boy who has been at school a whole year can sin in
    ignorance, and a boy who despises this warning is justly turned
    out of the school on conviction."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_240"
       id="Page_240"></a></p>

    <p>Finally, he dwelt upon the necessity of school life having
    joined to it a home life. The purifying influence of a good
    woman and a fuller recognition of woman's work and place in the
    world he looked upon as that which promised most for lifting
    mankind into a higher atmosphere of pure life.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
